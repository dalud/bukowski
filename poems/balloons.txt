today they shot a guy who was

selling balloons at the
intersection.

they parked their cars at the

curbing
and called him
over.

he came

over.

they argued with him about

the price of a
balloon, they wanted him
to come down in
price.

he said he couldn't.

one of them started calling

him names.

the other took out a gun

and shot him in the
head.
twice.

he fell

right there
in the street.


they took his balloons,

said, "now we can
party," and then they
drove off

there are also other guys

at that intersection, they

sell oranges
mostly.

they left then

and they weren't at the

intersection the next day

or the next or
the next.

nobody was.
