the doctor is into collecting art

and the magazines in his waiting room

are Artsy
have thick covers, glistening pages,

and large color
photos.

the receptionist calls my name and

I'm led into a waiting room with
walls adorned with paintings
and a chart of the human
body.

the doctor enters: "how are you

doing?"

not well, I think, or I wouldn't

be here.

"now," he goes on, "I am surprised

by the biopsy, I didn't expect
this…"

the doctor is a bald, well-scrubbed

pink fellow.

"I can almost always tell just by

looking; this time, I
missed…"


he paused.


"go on," I say.

"all right, let's say there are

4 types of cancer—A, B, C, D.
well, you've got
D.
and if I had cancer I'd rather
have your kind:
D."

the doctor is in a tough business

but the pay is
good.

"well," he says, "we'll just burn it off,

o.k.?"

I stretch out on the table and he has an

instrument, I can feel the heat of it
searing through the air
but also
I hear a whirring sound
like a drill.

"it'll be over in a

blink…"

the small growth is just inside of

the right nostril.
the instrument touches it
and
the room is filled with the smell
of burning flesh.

then he stops.

then he starts

again.

there is pain but it's sharp and

centered.

he stops

again.
"now we are going to do it
once more to
clean it
up."

he applies the instrument

again.
this time I feel the most
pain.

"there now…"

it's finished, no bandage needed,

it's
cauterized.

then I'm at the receptionist's

desk, she makes out a bill, I
pay with my
Mastercard, am out the door,
down the stairway and there
in the parking lot
awaits
my faithful automobile.

It's a day with a great deal of

afternoon left


I light a cigarette, start the

car and

get the hell
out of there

moving toward something

else.
