a warrior

I come in from a long but
victorious day
at the track.

she greets me with some

trash
which I carry and dump
into the garbage
can.

"Jesus Christ," she says,

"push the lid down tight!
the ants will be
everywhere!"

I push the lid down tight.

I think of Amsterdam.

I think of pigeons flying from a
roof.
I think of Time dangling from
a
paper clip.

she's right, of course: the lid

should be
tight.

I walk slowly back

into

the

house.
