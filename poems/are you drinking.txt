washed-up, on shore, the old yellow notebook out again
I write from the bed
as I did last
year.

will see the doctor,

Monday.

"yes, doctor, weak legs, vertigo, head-aches

and my back
hurts."

"are you drinking?" he will ask.

"are you getting your
exercise, your
vitamins?"

I think that I am just ill

with life, the same stale yet
fluctuating
factors.

even at the track

I watch the horses run by
and it seems
meaningless.

I leave early after buying tickets on the

remaining races.

"taking off?" asks the mutuel

clerk.

"yes, it's boring,"

I tell him.
"if you think it's boring

out there," he tells me, "you oughta be

back here."

so here I am

propped against my pillows
again

just an old guy

just an old writer
with a yellow
notebook.

something is

walking across the
floor
toward
me.

oh, it's just

my cat

this

time.
