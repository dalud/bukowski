finished,

can't find the handle,
mugged in the backalleys of nowhere,
too many dark days and nights,
too many unkind noons, plus a
steady fixation for
the ladies of death.

I am

finished. roll me
up, package
me,
toss me
to the birds of Normandy or the
gulls of Santa Monica, I
no longer
read
I
no longer
breed,
I
talk to old men over quiet
fences.

is this where my suicide complex

uncomplexes?:
as
I am asked over the telephone:
did you ever know Kerouac?

I now allow cars to pass me on the freeway.

I haven't been in a fist fight for 15 years.

I have to get up and piss 3 times a night.


and when I see a sexpot on the street I

only see
trouble.
I am
finished, back to square one,
drinking alone and listening to classical

music.

much about dying is getting ready.

the tiger walks through my dreams.
the cigarette in my mouth just exploded.

curious things still do

occur.

no, I never knew Kerouac.

so you see:

my life wasn't
useless
after
all.
