Mr. Sanderson was the principal of

my high school
and it seemed that much
of the time
I was in Mr. Sanderson's
office
and I had no idea
why.

the teacher would send me down

with a sealed
envelope.
Mr. Sanderson would open the
envelope
read the enclosure
and then look at
me.

"well, here we are

again!
we just can't behave ourselves,
can
we?"

he always said the same

thing.
I rather liked the idea of
being bad
but I had no idea
that I
was.

I didn't protest

because
I thought that
the teachers were
stupid
and that
Mr. Sanderson was
stupid
so
there was nobody
to protest
to.
certainly not
my parents
who were more stupid
than
any of
them.

"all right," Mr. Sanderson would

say, "go into the phone booth,

close the door
and don't come out until I
tell you
to."

it was one of those

glassed in phone booths with a

little seat.
all the times I sat there
the phone never
rang.
and it was stuffy
in there.
all you could do in there
was think
and I didn't want to
think.

Mr. Sanderson knew that.

there were magazines in
there
but they were all dull,
fancy ladies
magazines
but I read them
anyhow
and that really made me
feel bad
which was what Mr.
Sanderson wanted.

finally

after one or two hours
he would bang on the
door with his big
fist and yell, "ALL RIGHT,
YOU CAN COME OUT OF THERE

NOW
AND I DON'T EVER WANT TO
SEE YOU IN HERE AGAIN!"

but

I'd be back
many times

never knowing

why.

finally

like somebody doing
time
I got out of that
high school
and it was a couple
of years later
that I read

in the newspaper

that Mr. Sanderson
had been
prosecuted
fined and
jailed
for
embezzlement of
school
funds.

while I had been

in that phone booth
diddling with
myself
that son of a
bitch
had been making
his
moves.

I felt like

going down to
the jail
and dumping a
bunch of
Ladies' Home Journal

on him
but of course
didn't.

felt good enough about it

just the way it was.
