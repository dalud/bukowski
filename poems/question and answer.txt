he sat naked and drunk in a room of summer night, running the blade of the knife under his fingernails, smiling, thinking of all the letters he had received

telling him that
the way he lived and wrote about
thatâ€”
it had kept them going when
all seemed
truly
hopeless.

putting the blade on the table, he

flicked it with a finger
and it whirled
in a flashing circle
under the light.

who the hell is going to save

me? he
thought.

as the knife stopped spinning

the answer came:
you're going to have to
save yourself.

still smiling,

he lit a cigarette

he poured another

drink

gave the blade another

spin.
