we are always asked

to understand the other person's
viewpoint
no matter how
out-dated
foolish or
obnoxious.

one is asked

to view
their total error
their life-waste
with
kindliness,
especially if they are
aged.

but age is the total of

our doing.
they have aged
badly
because they have
lived
out of focus,
they have refused to
see.

not their fault?

whose fault?

mine?

I am asked to hide

my viewpoint
from them
for fear of their
fear.

age is no crime

but the shame

of a deliberately
wasted
life

among so many

deliberately
wasted
lives

is.
