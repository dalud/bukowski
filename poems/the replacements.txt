Jack London drinking his life away while writing of strange and heroic men. Eugene O'Neill drinking himself oblivious while writing his dark and poetic works.

now our moderns

lecture at universities
in tie and suit,
the little boys soberly studious,
the little girls with glazed eyes
looking
up,
the lawns so green, the books so dull,
the life so dying of
thirst.
