I never watch tv so I don't know

but I'm told he was the leading man in a

long-running
series.
he does movie bits
now
I see him at the track almost every

day ("I used to have women coming out of my ass," he once informed me).

and people still remember him, call him by name and my wife often asks me, "did you see him today?"

"oh yes, he's a gambling son of a bitch."

the track is where you go when the other action drops away.

he still looks like a celebrity, the way

he walks and talks and
I never meet him without feeling
good.

the toteboard flashes.

the sky shakes.

the mountains call us home.
