after 9 long races among greedy faces

on a hot Sunday that hardly rhymes with

reason
I have murdered another day,

come out with shoelaces flopping (while

secretly craving to be in a moss-lined

cave, say,
watching black and white cartoons
while wanton simplicity soothes the
muddled brain)
as my buddy the valet races the
machine up, revving the 8-year-old
engine, he leaps
out:
"how ya doin', baby?"

"things have me by the jugular, Frank,

I'm ready to run up the white
flag."
"not you, baby, you're my
leader!"
"you can do better than that,
Frank…"

I get in, hook the seat belt, put on

the driving glasses, put it in first…

"hey, man," he sticks his head into the

window, "let's go out and get drunk and

kick some ass and find some
pussy!"


I tell him, "I'll consider that."


as I pull out I can see him in the rearview mirror: he's giving me the finger.

I smile for the first time in 7 or

8 hours.
