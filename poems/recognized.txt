I was at the airport

standing at the arrival section
with my wife
waiting for her sister's
flight in
when a young man walked up:
"aren't you Henry Chinaski?"
"well, yes…"
"oh, I thought so!"
there was a pause.
then
he continued: "you don't
know what this
means to me!
I can't believe it!
I've read all your books!"
"thank you," I said, "I have to be
thankful for my
readers."
he gave me his name and we
shook hands.
"this is my wife," I started…
"Sarah!" he said,
"I know her
from your books!"
another pause.
then:
"I get all your books from Red
down at Baroque…
I still can't believe it's
you!"
"it is," laughed my wife,
"it's him!"

"well," he said, "I'll leave you

alone now!"
"tell Red I said ‘hello.'"
then the young man
moved off.
"he was all right," I said,
"I usually can't stand
them."

"like you say, you have to

be thankful for your
readers."

"damned right…"

then her sister's plane tooled

up and we moved with the others

to greet those we knew and those

who knew
us.
