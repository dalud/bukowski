the lady down at the end of the bar keeps looking at me, I put my head down, I look away, I light
a cigarette, glance again: she's still staring at me, she's charmingly dressed and she, herself, well, you might say she's beautiful.
her eyes meld with mine; I am
elated and nervous, then
she gets up, goes to the ladies' room:
such a behind!
such grace!
what a gazelle!

I glance at my face in the bar mirror, look away.

she's back; then the barkeep comes down: "a drink from the lady at the end of the bar."

I nod thanks to her, lift my drink, smile, have a hit.

she is looking again, what a strange and pleasurable experience.

I look forward, examine the backs of my handsâ€”not bad hands as far as hands go.

then, at once, it occurs to me:

she has mistaken me for somebody
else.

I leave my stool and slowly walk to the exit,

and out into the night; I walk half a block down the

boulevard, feel the need for a smoke, slip the
pack of cigarettes out of my coat pocket, look

curiously at the brand name (I did not purchase

these): DEATH, it
says.

I curse, hurl the pack into the street, move toward the next bar: knew it all along: she was a whore.
