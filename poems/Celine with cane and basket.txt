tonight I am nothing

I have lost touch with the walls
I have seen too many heads, hands, feet,
heard too many voices,
I am weary with the continuation,
the music is old music,
there is no stirring in the air.

on my wall is a photo of

Celine,
he has a cane,
carries a basket,
wears a coat too heavy,
a long strand of hair falls across his face, he has been stunned by life, the dogs have had at him,
it got to be too much
much too much.

he walks through a small forest,

this doctor,
this typer of words,
all he wants to do is die,
that's all he wants,
and his photo is on the wall
and he is dead.

this year

1988
all these months
have had
a terribleness to them

that I have never felt

before.

I light a cigarette and

wait.
