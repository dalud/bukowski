I must wash this buddha that sits on my desk— dust and grime all over him mostly on his chest and belly; ah,
we have endured many long nights together; we have

endured trivia and horror; at unseemly times we
have laughed
cleanly—now
the least he deserves is a good
going over
with a wet rag;
truly terrible have been
some long nights but
the buddha has been good, quiet
company; he never quite looks at me but
he seems to be forever laughing—he's
laughing at this muck of
existence: there's nothing to be done.

"why clean me?" he now asks, "I will only dirty again."

"I am only pretending at some dumb sanity," I answer.

"drink your wine," he responds, "that's what you're good at."
"and," I ask, "what are you good
at?"

he returns: "I am good at almost watching you."

then he becomes silent.

he holds a circle of beads with a
tassel.


how did he get in

here?
