waiting for death

like a cat
that will jump on the
bed

I am so very sorry for

my wife

she will see this

stiff
white
body

shake it once, then

maybe
again:

"Hank!"

Hank won't

answer.

it's not my death that

worries me, it's my wife
left with this
pile of
nothing.

I want to

let her know
though

that all the nights

sleeping
beside her

even the useless

arguments
were things
ever splendid

and the hard

words
I ever feared to
say
can now be
said:

love you.
