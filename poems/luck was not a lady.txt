being half-young I sat about the bars

in it up to the ears
thinking something might happen to
me, I mean, I tried the ladies:
"hey, baby, listen, the golden coast
weeps for your beauty…"
or some such.

their heads never turned, they looked

ahead, straight ahead,
bored.

"hey, baby, listen, I am a

genius, ha ha ha…"

silent before the bar mirror, these

magic creatures, these secret sirens,
big-legged, bursting out of their
dresses, wearing dagger
heels, earrings, strawberry mouths,
just sitting there, sitting there,
sitting there.

one of them told me, "you bore

me."

"no, baby, you got it

backwards…"

"oh, shut up."

then in would walk some dandy, some fellow neat in a suit, pencil mustache, bow tie; he would be slim, light, delicate
and so knowing
and the ladies would call his
name: "oh, Murray, Murray!"
or some such.

"hi, girls!"

I knew I could deck one of those

fuckers but that hardly mattered in the
scheme of things,
the ladies just gathered around Murray
(or some such) and I just kept ordering
drinks,
sharing the juke music with them
and listening to the laughter from
the outside.

I wondered what wonderful things I was missing, the secret of the magic, something that only they knew, and I felt myself again the idiot in the schoolyard, sometimes a man never got out of there—he was marked, it could be told at a glance

and so

I was shut out,
"I am the lost face of
Janus," I might say at some
momentary silence.
of course, to be
ignored.

they'd pile out

to cars parked in back

smoking

laughing
finally to drive off
to some consummate
victory
leaving me
to keep on drinking
just me
sitting there
then the face of the
bartender near
mine:

"LAST CALL!"

his meaty indifferent face

cheap in the cheap
light
to have my last drink

go out to my ten year old car

at the curb
get in
to drive ever so carefully
to my rented
room

remembering the schoolyard

again,
recess time,
being chosen next to last
on the baseball team,
the same sun shining on me

as on them,
now it was night,
most people of the world
together.
my cigarette dangling,
I heard the sound of the

engine.
