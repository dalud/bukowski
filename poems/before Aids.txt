I'm glad I got to them

all, I'm glad I got so many of them
in.

I flipped them

poked them
gored them.

so many high-heeled shoes

under my bed
it looked like a January
Clearance Sale.

the cheap hotel rooms,

the drunken fights,
the phones ringing,
the walls banging

was wild red-eyed big-balled unshaven poor foul-mouthed

laughed plenty

and I picked them off

the barstools
like
ripe plums.


dirty sheets

bad whiskey
bad breath
cheap cigars
and to hell with the next
morning.

I always slept with my

wallet under my
pillow
bedded down with the
depressed and the
crazies.

I was barred from half the

hotels in
Los Angeles.

I'm glad I got to them all,

I plugged and banged and
sang and
some of them
sang with me
on those glorious
3 a.m. mornings.
when the cops
arrived, that was
grand,
we barricaded the doors
and taunted
them

and they never waited around

until noon
(checking-out time) to
arrest us,
we weren't that
important


but

I thought we were
walking toward the bar,

and what a place the bar was

around noon, so quiet and

empty,
a place to begin
again,
to buck up with a quiet
beer,
looking out across at the
park
with the ducks over there
and the tall trees
over there.

so,

always broke but always
money from somewhere,

waited getting ready to

plug and bang and poke and sing again

in those good old times in those very very very good old times before Aids.
