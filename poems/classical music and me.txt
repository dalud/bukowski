I have no idea how it began.

as a boy I believed that classical music was for sissies and as a teenager I felt this even more strongly.

yes, I think it began in this record

store.
I was in my booth listening to whatever I
listened to
at that time.
then I heard some music in the next
booth.
the sounds seemed very strange and
unusual.
I saw the man leave his booth and
return the record to the clerk.
I went to the clerk and asked for that
record.
she handed it to me.
I looked at the cover.

"but," I said, "this is symphony

music."

"yes," said the clerk.

I took the record to my booth

and played it.

never had I heard such

music.
unfortunately, I no longer

remember what that

piece of marvelous
music was.
I purchased the record.

I had a record player in my

room.
I listened to the record
over and over
again.

I was hooked.

soon I found a 2nd hand

record store.
there I found that you could

turn in 3 record albums and

get two back.

I was fairly poor

but most of my money went

for wine and
classical music.
I loved to mix the two
together.

I went through that entire

2nd hand record
store.

my tastes were strange.

I liked Beethoven but
preferred Brahms and
Tchaikovsky.
Borodin didn't work.
Chopin was only good
at moments.
Mozart was only good
when I was feeling

good and I seldom

felt that
way.
Smetana I found
obvious and Sibelius
awesome.

Ives was too self-comfortable.

Goldmark, I felt, was very
underrated.

Wagner was a roaring miracle

of dark energy.
Haydn was love turned loose

into sound.
Handel created things that
took your head and lifted it
to the ceiling.
Eric Coates was unbelievably

cute and astute.
and if you listened to Bach
long enough
you didn't want to listen to
anybody else.
there were dozens
more….

I was on the move from

city to city
and carrying a record player

and records along was
impossible
so I began listening to the
radio
and picking up what I
could.

the problem with the radio

was
that there were a few standard

works they played over and

over.
I heard them too often
and could anticipate each note
before it
arrived.
but the good part was
that, at times, I heard new
music that I had never heard
before by composers I had
never heard of, read about.
I was surprised at the many
composers, fairly unknown,
at least to me, who could
produce these wondrous
and stirring
works.
works that I would never
hear again.

I have continued to listen to

classical music via the radio
for decades.
I am listening as I write
this to Mahler's 9th.
Mahler was always one
of my favorites.
it's possible to listen to
his works again and
again without
tiring of
them.

through the women, through

the jobs, through the horrible
times and the good times,

through deaths, through everything,

in and out of hospitals,

in and out of love, through the

decades that have gone so
swiftly
there have been so many
nights of listening
to classical music on the
radio.
almost every
night.

I wish I could remember the name of

the piece I first heard in that
record booth
but it evades me.
for some odd reason I do
remember the conductor:
Eugene Ormandy.
one of the
finest.

now Mahler is in the room

with me
and the chills run up my
arms, reach the back
of my neck…
it's all so unbelievably
splendid,
splendid!
and I can't read a note of
music.
But I have found a part of
the world

like no other part of the

world.
it gave heart to my
life, helped me get
to
here.
