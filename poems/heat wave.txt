another one.

this night the people sit drunk or drugged or some of them

sit in front of their tv sets
slapped silly.
some few have air-conditioning.

the neighborhood dogs and cats flop about waiting for a better time.

and I remember the cars along the freeway today some of them stalled in the fast lane, hoods up.

there are more murders in the heat

more domestic arguments.

Los Angeles has been burning for

weeks.

even the desperately lonely have not phoned

and that alone
makes all this almost
worthwhile:

those little mewling voices cooked into

silence
as I listen to the music of a long dead man
written in the 19th
century.
