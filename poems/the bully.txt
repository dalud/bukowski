actually, I do think that

my father was
insane,
the way he drove his
car,
honking,
cursing at people;
the way he got into
violent arguments
in public places
over the most
trivial incidents;
the way he beat
his only child
almost daily
upon the slightest
provocation.

of course, bullies

sometimes meet their
masters.

I remember once

entering the house
and my mother
told me,
"your father was
in a terrible
fight."

I looked for him,

found him sitting

on the toilet

with the bathroom
door
open.

his face was a mass of

bruises, welts,
puffed and black
eyes.

he even had a broken

arm
in a cast.

I was 13 years old.

I stood looking
at him.
I looked for
some time.

then he screamed,

"what the hell you
staring at!
what's your
problem?"

I looked at him

some more,
then walked
off.

it was to be

3 years later
that
I would knock him
on his
ass, no problem
with that
at
all.
