it's always a surprise to some

when the killer is that clean-cut
quiet boy with the gentle smile
who went to church
and was nearly a straight-A
student
and also good on the athletic
field,
kind to his elders,
adored by the young girls,
the old ones,
admired by his
peers.

"I can't believe he did itâ€¦"

they always think a killer must

be ugly, gross, unlikable,
that he must give off signs,
signals of anger and
madness.

sometimes these kill

too.

but a potential killer can never

be judged by his
externals

nor a politician, a priest or

a poet.

or the dog

or the woman
wagging
tails.

the killer sits anywhere

like you
as you read this

wondering.
