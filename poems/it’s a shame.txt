it's a shame

a great mind and a good body seldom go together.
or a great body and a good
mind.
or a great body and a great
mind.

but worse, a not so good mind and a

not so good body often go
together.

in fact, that's almost the entire

populace.
and all these
reproducing more of
themselves.

is there any wonder why the world

is where it's at
now?

just notice the creature sitting near you

in a movie house
or standing ahead of you in a
supermarket line.
or giving a State of the Union
Address.

that the gods have let us go on

this long
this badly.

as the snail comes crawling home

to manna.
