I go to the men's crapper

for a bowel
movement,
get up to flush.
what the hell.
something blood-dark
falls upon the
seat.
I'm 70, I
drink.
have been on my deathbed
twice.
I reach down for what has
fallen…
it's a small burnt
potato chip
from my
lunch.
not yet…
damn thing fell from my
shirt…

I finish my toiletry,

go out and watch the
race.
my horse runs
second
chasing a 25-to-one
shot
to the
wire.

I don't mind.

then I see this fellow

rushing toward me,
he always needs a

shave, his glasses seem

about to fall off
his face,
he knows me
and maybe I know
him.

"hey, Hank, Hank!"

we shake hands like two

lost souls.
"always good to see you,"

he says, "it refreshes
me, I know you lead a
hard life
just like I
do."

"sure, kid, how you

doing?"

he tells me that he is

a big winner
then
rushes off.
the big board
overhead
flashes the first odds
on the next
race.

I check my program

decide to leave the

clubhouse,

try my luck in the
grandstand,

that's where a hard-living

player belongs
anyhow,
right?

right.
