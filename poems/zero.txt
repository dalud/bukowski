dark taste in mouth, my neck is stiff, I am looking for my sonic vibrator, the music on my radio is diseased, the winds of death seep through my slippers, and a terrible letter in the mail today from a pale non-soul who requests that he may come by to see me

in repayment, he says, for a ride he gave me home from a drunken Pasadena party 20 years ago.
also, one of the cats shit on the rug this
morning
and in the first race I bet this afternoon
the horse tossed the jock
coming out of the gate.

downstairs

I have a large photo of Hemingway
drunk before noon in Havana, he's on the floor mouth open, his big belly trying to flop out of his shirt.

I feel like that photo and I'm not even drunk.

maybe
that's the problem.

whatever the problem is, it's there, and worse, it shouldn't be

for I have been a lucky man, I shouldn't even be here
after all I have done to myself
and after all they have done
to me
I ought to be kneeling to the gods and giving

thanks.

instead, I deride their kindness by being
impatient
with the world.

maybe a damned good night's sleep will bring me back to a gentle sanity.

but at the moment, I look about this room and, like myself, it's all in disarray: things fallen

out of place, cluttered, jumbled, lost, knocked over, and I can't put it straight, don't want to.

perhaps living through these petty days will get us ready for the dangerous ones.
