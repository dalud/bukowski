you haven't lived

until you've been in a
flophouse
with nothing but one
light bulb
and 56 men
squeezed together
on cots
with everybody
snoring
at once
and some of those
snores
so
deep and
gross and
unbelievableâ€”
dark
snotty
gross
subhuman
wheezings
from hell
itself.

your mind

almost breaks
under those
death-like
sounds


and the

intermingling

odors:
hard

unwashed socks

pissed and
shitted
underwear

and over it all

slowly circulating

air
much like that
emanating from
uncovered
garbage
cans.

and those

bodies
in the dark

fat and

thin
and
bent

some

legless
armless

some

mindless

and worst of

all:
the total
absence of
hope


it shrouds

them
covers them
totally.
it's not
bearable.

you get

up

go out

walk the

streets

up and

down
sidewalks

past buildings


around the

corner

and back

up
the same
street

thinking

those men

were all
children
once

what has happened

to
them?

and what has

happened
to
me?
it's dark
and cold
out
here.
