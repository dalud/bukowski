the fight I saw,

after the tv cameras were
shut off,
a fighter in green
trunks and
a fighter in blue,
only 50 to 75
absolutely silent
people
remaining,
you heard each
blow
land
crushingly
amid
sweat, saliva
blood,
gasps of
agony,
drinks no longer
served,
all the lights
on,
thousands of
empty
seats,
the bell rang
to end the
round,
it clanged
right through
you
as the boxers

went back

sat on their

stools
and were

swabbed by

listless
cornermen.

we were all

in hell
all of us
and I
got up
and left
that time.
