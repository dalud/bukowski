it's no longer any good, sucker, they've

turned out the lights, they've
blocked the rear entrance
and
the front's on fire;
nobody knows your name;
down at the opera they play
checkers;
the city fountains piss
blood;
the extremities are reamed
and
they've hung the best
barber;
the dim souls have ascended;
the cardboard souls smile;
the love of dung is unanimous;
it's no longer any good, sucker, the
graves have emptied out onto the
living;
last is first,
lost is everything;
the giant dogs mourn through dandelion
dreams;
the panthers welcome cages;
the onion heart is frosted,
destiny is destitute,
the horns of reason are muted as
the laughter of fools blockades the air;
the champions are dead
and
the newly born are smitten;
the jetliners vomit the eyeless through

space;

it's no longer any good, sucker, it's been

getting to that
right along
and now
it's here
and you can't touch it smell it see it
because it's nothing everywhere as

you look up or down or turn or sit or stand or sleep or run,
it's no longer any good, sucker.
it's no longer any good
sucker sucker sucker
and
if you don't already know
I'm not surprised
and
if you do, sucker, good
luck
in the dark
going nowhere.
