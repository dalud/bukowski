my wife likes movie houses, the popcorn and soft drinks, the settling into seats, she finds a child's delight in
this and I am happy for her—but really, I myself, I must have come from another place, I must have been a mole in another life, something that burrowed and hid alone:

the other people crowded in the seats, near and far, give me feelings that I dislike; it's stupid, maybe, but there it is; and then
there's the darkness and then the
giant human faces, bodies, that move about on the screen, they

speak and we
listen.

of one hundred movies there's one that's fair, one that's good and ninety eight that are very bad. most movies start badly and steadily get
worse;

if you can believe the actions and speech of the characters
you might even believe that the popcorn you chew also
has a meaning of
sorts.

(well, it might be that people see so many movies that when they finally see one not so bad as the others, they think it's

great. an Academy Award means that you don't stink quite as much as your cousin.)

the movie ends and we are out in the street, moving

toward the car; "well," says my wife, "it wasn't as
good as they say."
"no," I say, "it wasn't."


"there were a few good parts, though," she replies.

"yeah," I answer.
we are at the car, get in, then I am driving us out of that part of town; we look around at the night; the night looks good.

"you hungry?" she asks.

"yes. you?"

we stop at a signal; I watch the red light;

I could eat that red light—anything, anything at

all to fill the void; millions of dollars spent to create something more terrible than the actual lives of most living things; one should never have to pay an admission to hell.

the light changes and we escape,

forward.
