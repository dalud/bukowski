the uselessness of the word is

evident.
I would like to make
this
piece of paper
shriek and dance and
laugh
but
the keys just
strike it harmlessly
and
we settle
for just a fraction of
the whole.

this incompleteness is all

we have:
we write the same things
over and over
again.
we are fools,
driven.

the uselessness of the word is

evident.

writers can only pretend to

succeed
some pretend well, others
not so


yet

none of us come

near
none of us even

close
sitting at these
machines

behooved to

live
out
our indecent
profession.
