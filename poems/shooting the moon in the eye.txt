it was just a small room, no bathroom,

hot plate, bed, 2 chairs, a bed, sink,
phone in hall.
I was on the 2nd floor of a hotel.
I had a job.
I got in about 6:30 p.m.
and by 8 p.m.
there would be 4 or 5 people
in the room,
all drunks,
all drinking wine.
sometimes there would be
6 or 7.
most of them sat on the
bed.
oh, there was a radio,
we played the radio,
drank and
talked.

it was strange, there was

always a sense of
excitement there,
some laughter and
sometimes serious
arguments that were
somewhat
stupid.

we were never asked

to be quiet,
the manager never

bothered us,

or the
police.
with an exception
or two,
there were no
physical
confrontations.
I'd always call an
end to the parties
around 3 a.m.

"ah, come on Hank!

we're just getting
started!"

"come on, come

on, everybody
out!"

and,

with an exception
or two,
I always slept
without a
lady.

we called

that place,
the Hotel from
Hell.

I had no idea

what we were
trying to
do.


I think we were

just celebrating

being
alive.

that small room

full of smoke and

music and
voices,
night after night
after
night.

the poor, the mad,

the lost.

we lit up that hotel

with our twisted
souls
and it loved
us.
