it would be good to get

out of here,
just go,
pop off, get away from
memories of this
and all
that,
but staying has its
flavor too:
all those babes who
thought they were
hot numbers
now living in dirty
flats
while looking forward
to the next
episode on
some Soap Opera,
and all those guys,
those who really
thought
they were going to
make it,
grinning in the
Year Book with their
tight-skinned
mugs,
now they are
cops,
clerk typists,
operators of
sandwich stands,
horse grooms,

plops

in the dust.
it's good to stay

around
to see what
happened to
all the
others-only

when you go to

the bathroom,
avoid the
mirror
and
don't look
at
what you
flush
away.
