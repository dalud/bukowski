I'm guilty, I did take one

in college
and the first thing I realized was that
I could beat the hell out of any
2 or 3 people in there
at once
(physically

mean) and

of course
this was no way to measure creativity.

also

I noticed that the professor's advice
on what to do
and what not to do
to become a writer was
very pale and standard stuff
that would lead to
nowhere.

some of the students' work

was read in class
and I found it to be embarrassingly
inept.

I sat alone in the back row with

my scowl
further noting that
the men didn't look like men and
the women didn't look like women.

again

no way to judge creativity.

but what they produced
looked like
what they were.
well
at least the prof did give me

"A's" on all the work
I turned in
but I got a "B" overall for
poor attendance.

I also knew that

every student in that class

except one
was
creatively doomed.

and even that one

would be 50 years old
before even minor notice
would be taken of
his work.

a bit longer

than even he
had
expected.
