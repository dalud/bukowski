he's 95, lives in a large two story

house.

"they want to send me to a rest

home. ‘hell,' I tell them, ‘this
IS my home!'"

he speaks of his grandchildren.

he's outlived his
children.

he visits his wife who's also

95.
she's in a rest
home.

"she looks great but she doesn't

know who I am."

he lives on bacon, tomatoes and

breakfast cereal.

he lives on a steep hill.

used to take his little dog for
walks.
the dog died.

he walks alone now,

straight-backed,
carrying an
oak cane.

he's 6 foot two,

lean,
jocular,
imposing.
"they can't wait for me to
die, they want my house
and money.
I'm gonna live just to
spite them."

I see him in his room upstairs

at night
watching tv or
reading.

he was married longer than

most men
live.
he still is

only she doesn't know she's

married.

he sits up in his room

on top of nine and one
half
decades
neither asking nor
giving
mercy.

he is an ocean of

wonder,
he is a shining
rock.

quick of mind,

so quick.

when death comes for

him
it should be
ashamed.

I so want to see that light burning

in that upstairs
window!

when it goes dark

it will be another world
not quite so magic
not quite so good

when it goes dark.
