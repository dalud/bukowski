being very ill and very weak is a very strange thing.

when it takes all your strength to get from the bedroom to the bathroom and back, it seems like a joke but
you don't laugh.

back in bed you consider death again and find the same thing: the closer you get to it the less forbidding it
becomes.

you have much time to examine the walls and outside
birds on a telephone wire take on much
importance.
and there's the tv: men playing baseball
day after day.

no appetite.

food tastes like cardboard, it makes you
ill, more than
ill.

the good wife keeps insisting that you

eat.
"the doctor saidâ€¦"

poor dear.


and the cats.

the cats jump up on the bed and look at me.

they stare, then jump
off.

what a world, you think: eat, work, fuck, die.
luckily I have a contagious disease: no
visitors.

the scale reads 155, down from

217.

I look like a man in a death camp.

I
am.

still, I'm lucky: I feast on solitude, I

will never miss the crowd.

I could read the great books but the great books don't interest me.

I sit in bed and wait for the whole thing to go

one way or the
other.

just like everybody

else.
