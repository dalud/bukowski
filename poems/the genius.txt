this man sometimes forgets who

he is.
sometimes he thinks he's the
Pope.

other times he thinks he's a

hunted rabbit
and hides under the
bed.

then

all at once
he'll recapture total
clarity
and begin creating
works of
art.

then he'll be all right

for some
time.

then, say,

he'll be sitting with his
wife
and 3 or 4 other
people
discussing various
matters

he will be charming,

incisive,

original.

then he'll do

something
strange.
like once
he stood up
unzipped
and began
pissing
on the
rug.

another time

he ate a paper
napkin.

and there was

the time
he got into his
car
and drove it
backwards
all the way to
the
grocery store
and back
again
backwards

the other motorists

screaming at
him
but he
made it
there and
back
without
incident

and without

being
stopped
by a patrol
car.
but he's best
as the
Pope
and his
Latin
is very
good.

his works of

art
aren't that
exceptional

but they allow him

to
survive
and to live with
a series of
19-year-old
wives
who
cut his hair
his toenails
bib
tuck and
feed
him.

he wears everybody

out
but
himself.
