some of the old rich still make it to

Santa Anita Turf Club parking.
and the old rich still buy Cadillacs—

and he can barely drive the Caddy—

and the valet helps them both
out.
he's fat and squat, very white, with
merry blue eyes and she's taller,
dignified but dumb, and her back is

bent.
expensively clothed

they both move toward the Turf Club

entrance
where they are swallowed forever
as the horn sounds to post

and the number one horse steps out

on the track
more beautiful than all the people
more beautiful than all the world
and it
begins.
