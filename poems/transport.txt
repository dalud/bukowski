I was a scraggly bum most of my

life
and to get from one city to another
I took the buses.
I don't know how many times I
saw the Grand Canyon,
going east to west
and west to east.
it was just dusty windows,
the backs of necks, stop-offs at
intolerable eating places
and always the old
constipation
blues.
and once, a half-assed romance
with no socially redeeming
value.

then I found myself riding the

trains.
the food was beautiful
and the restrooms were
lovely
and I stayed in the bar
cars.
some of them were
so grand:
round curving picture
windows
and large overhead
domes,
the sun shone right on

down through your

glass
and at night you could
get
stinko
and watch the stars and
the moon ride
right along with
you.

and the best, since there was more

space
people weren't forced
to speak to
you.

then after the trains I found

myself on the
jetliners,
quick trips to cities and
back.
I was like many of the
others:
I had a briefcase
and was writing on pieces
of paper.
I was on the hustle.
and I hustled and hounded the
stewardesses for drink after
drink.
the food and the view were
bad.
and the people tended to
talk to you
but there were ways to
discourage
that.
the worst about flying was that
there were people waiting for

you at the airports.

baggage was no problem:
you had your carry-on bag,

change of underwear, socks,

one shirt, toothbrush, razor,
liquor.
then the jetliners stopped.
you stayed in the city,
you shacked with unsavory
ladies and you purchased a
series of old cars.
you were much luckier with the

cars than with the
ladies.
you bought the cars for a
song
and drove them with a classic

abandon.
they never needed an oil
change and they lasted and
lasted.
on one the springs were
broken.
on another they stuck up
out of the seat and into your
ass.
one had no reverse
gear.
this was good for me,
it was like playing a game of
chessâ€”

keeping your King from getting

checkmated.
another would only start
when parked on a
hill.
there was one where the

lights wouldn't go on until you

hit a bump

HARD.

of course, they all died

finally.
and it was always a true
heartbreaker for me when
I had to watch them towed off
to the junkyard.

another I lost when it was impounded

on a drunk driving
rap.

they sent me an impound bill that was

four times larger than the purchase

price
so I let them keep
it.

the best car I ever had was the one

my first wife gave me when divorcing

me.
it was two years old,
as old as our marriage.

but the last car was (and is)

the very best, purchased new for
$30,000 cash. (well, I wrote
them a check).
it has everything: air bag,
anti-lock brakes, everything.

also, 2 or 3 times a year

people send a limousine
so we can attend various
functions.
these are very nice
because you can drink like
hell and not worry about the

drunk tank.

but I'm going to bypass that

private plane, that private
boat.
upkeep and rental space
can be a real pain in the
butt.

I'll tell you one thing, though,

one night not so long
ago
I had a dream that I
could fly.
I mean, just by working
my arms and my legs
I could fly through the
air
and I did.

there were all these people

on the ground,
they were reaching up their

arms and trying to pull me
down
but
they couldn't do
it.

I felt like pissing on

them.
they were so
jealous.

all they had to do was

to work their way
slowly up to it
as I had
done.

such people think

success grows on

trees.

you and I,

we know
better.
