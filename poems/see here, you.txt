blazing bastard fools

poets
with your
idiot scrolls
you are so
pompous
in your
knowledge
so
assured
that you are
on a hot roll
to
nirvana

you

soft lumps of
humanity

you

imitators of
other
pretenders

you are still

in
the shadow of
the
Mother

you

have never

bargained with

the
Beast
you have never
tasted
the full flavor of
Hell

you have never

seen
the Edge of
yourself
you have never
been alone
with the
razor-sharp
walls

you

blazing bastard fools

with your
idiot scrolls

there is nothing

to
know

no place

to
travel

your

lives
your
deaths
your
idiot
scrolls


useless

disgusting

and

not as real

as

the

wart
on the ass
of
a
hog.

you

are rejected by

circumstance.

good

bye.
