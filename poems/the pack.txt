the dogs are at it again; they leap and

tear, back off, circle, then
attack again.

and I had thought this was over, I had

thought that they had
forgotten; now there are only
more of them.

and I am older,

now

but the dogs are

ageless

and as always they tear not only at

the flesh but also at
the mind and the spirit.

now

they are circling me
in this room.

they are not

beautiful; they are the dogs
from hell

and they will find you

too


even though you are one

of them

now.
