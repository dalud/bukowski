it's no use, I've got to admit,

I am into my first real
writer's block
after over

decades of typing.

I have some excuses: I've had a long illness

and I'm nearing the age of 70.

and when you're near
70 you always consider the possibility of

slippage.
but I am bucked-up by the fact that Cervantes

wrote his greatest work at the age of

80.
but how many Cervantes are there?

I've been spoiled with the

easy way I have created
things,
and now there's this
miserable
stoppage.

and now

spiritually constipated I've
grown testy,
have screamed at my wife
twice this week,
once smashing a glass
into the sink.
bad form,
sick nerves,
bad
style.

I should accept this

writer's block.
hell, I'm lucky I'm alive,
I'm lucky I don't have
cancer.
I'm lucky in a hundred
different ways.
sometimes at night
in bed
at one or two a.m.
I will think about
how lucky I am
and it keeps me
awake.

now I've always written in a

selfish way, that is, to please

myself.
by writing things down I have

been better able to
live with them.

now, that's

stopped.


I see other old men with canes

sitting at bus stop benches,

staring straight into the sun and

seeing nothing.
and I know there are other
old men
in hospitals and nursing
homes
sitting upright in their
beds
grunting over
bedpans.
death is nothing, brother,
it's life that's
hard.

writing has been my fountain

of youth,
my whore,
my love,
my gamble.

the gods have spoiled me.

yet look, I am still

lucky,
for writing about a
writer's block
is better than not writing
at all.
