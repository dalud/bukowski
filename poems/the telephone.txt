will bring you people

with its ring,
people who do not know what to do with their time
and they will ache to
infect you with
this
from a distance
(although they would prefer
to actually be in the same room
to better project their nullity upon
you).

the telephone is needed for

emergency purposes only.

these people are not

emergencies, they are
calamities.

I have never welcomed the ring of a

telephone.

"hello," I will answer

guardedly.

"this is Dwight."

already you can feel their imbecile

yearning to invade.
they are the people-fleas that

crawl the

psyche.

"yes, what is it?"

"well, I'm in town tonight and
I thought…"

"listen, Dwight, I'm tied up, I

can't…"

"well, maybe another

time?"

"maybe not…"

each person is only given so many

evenings
and each wasted evening is
a gross violation against the
natural course of
your only
life;
besides, it leaves an aftertaste
which often lasts two or three days

depending upon the
visitor.

the telephone is only for

emergency purposes.

it has taken me

decades
but I have finally found out
how to say
"no."


now

don't be concerned for them,

please:
they will simply dial another

number.

it could be

yours.
"hello," you will
say.

and they will say,

"this is Dwight."

and then

you
be
the kind
understanding
soul.
