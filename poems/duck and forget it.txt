today at the track

I was standing alone
looking down
when I saw these
two shoes
moving directly
toward
me

at once

I started into motion
toward my right
but he still caught part of
me:

"making any money

today?"

"yeah," I answered and

was gone.

not too many years ago

I would have stood
there
while this slipped
soul
unloaded his
inanities on
me
pissing over my day
and my feelings
as he made me pay

for where he allowed

himself to be
in his mind
and in his
life.
no longer.

yet I am my brother's

keeper.

I keep him

away.
