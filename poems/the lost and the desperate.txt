it was nice to be a boy in a dark movie house, one entered the dream so much more easily then.
I liked the French Foreign Legion movies best and there were many of them then.

I loved the forts and the sand and the

lost and desperate men.
these men were brave and they had beautiful eyes.

I never saw men like that

in my neighborhood.
the neighborhood men were hunched and miserable and angry and cowardly.

I was going to join the French Foreign Legion.

I sat in the dark movie houses and I was

one of them.

we had been fighting for days without food

and with very little
water.

casualties had been horrendous.

our fort was surrounded, we were down to a last few.

we propped up our dead comrades with

their rifles pointed toward the
desert

to make the Arabs think that they had not killed many of us
otherwise we would have been
overwhelmed.

we ran from dead man to dead man

firing their rifles.
our sergeant was wounded
3 or 4 times but
he still commanded
screaming his orders.

then more of us died gallantly, then

we were down to the last two
(one of them the sergeant) but we
fought on, then we were out of
ammunition, the Arabs scaled the walls
on ladders and we knocked them back
with our rifle butts but more and more of
them were clambering over the walls, there
were too many
of them we were

finished, no chance, then there was the sound of a

BUGLE!
reinforcements were arriving!

fresh and rested upon the backs of thunderous horses!
they charged en masse over the sand,
hundreds of them
dressed in bright and blazing uniforms.
the Arabs scattered down the walls
running for their horses and their
lives
but most of them were
doomed.


then the sergeant, knowing victory, was dying in my arms.
"Chinaski," he said to me, "the fort is
ours!"

he gave a small smile, his head fell back and he was gone.
then I was home again
I was back in my room.
a hunched, miserable and angry man
walked into the room and said,
"get out there now and mow the lawn.
I see a hair of grass sticking up!"

out there in the yard

I pushed the mower over the same grass
once more
back and forth
back and forth
wondering why all the brave men with
beautiful eyes were so far away,
wondering if they'd still be there
when I arrived.
