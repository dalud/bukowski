sometimes I am hit

for change
3 or 4 times
in twenty minutes
and nine times out of
ten I'll
give.
the time or two
that I don't
I have an instinctive
reaction
not to
and I
don't
but mostly I
dig and
give
but each time
I can't help but
remember
the many times
hollow-eyed
my skin tight to the
ribs
my mind airy and
mad
I never asked
anybody
for anything
and it wasn't
pride
it was simply because
I didn't respect

them

didn't regard them

as worthy human

beings.
they were the
enemy
and they still are
as I dig
in
and
give.
