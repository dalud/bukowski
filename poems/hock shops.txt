were always all right with me

because when I tried to sell something in the street there were no takers.

of course, the shops offered far less than real value;

they had to profit on the
resale,
but at least, they were
there.

my favorite shop was a place in Los Angeles— this fellow would lead me to a booth where he would gather a black curtain all around us,

it slid on little rings
and then
we would be enclosed.

and it always went like

this:

"show me," he would

say.

I would place the item on the table under

the very strong
light.

he would examine the item, then look at me for some time.

"I can't give you very much for

this."

another pause, then he would name his

price.
the offer was always more than I
expected.

"I'll take $10," I would name a

higher price.

"no," he would answer, "in fact…"

and then he would mention a lower price

than his original
offer.

at times I would attempt to joke with

him:

"if I stay here long enough, I'll be

paying you…"

he wouldn't smile.

"we don't have to do business at

all."

"listen, I'll accept your first offer…"

"very well," he would say,

"but I will lose on
this…"

then he would write out the

pawn ticket and give me the
money.

"please be sure to read your ticket,

there are
stipulations."

then he would turn off the light

and pull the black curtain
away…
sometimes I was able to retrieve one
of the items
but eventually they all returned
forever.

also, I found out that the one thing

you could sell in the bars and on the
street were
hock shop tickets.

the hock shops helped me through some terrible times and I was glad they were there when nothing else
was, and that booth with the black
curtain: what a marvelous sanctuary,
a place to give up something for
something else that you needed
much more.

how many typewriters, suits, gloves and

watches I left in the hock shops
I have no
idea,
but those places were always
all right
with me.
