not much chance in

Amsterdam;
cheese dislikes the
flea;
the center fielder
turns
runs back
in his stupid
uniform,
times it all
perfectly:
ball and man
arriving as
one
he
gloves it
precisely
in tune with the
universe;
not much chance in
east
Kansas City;
and
have you noticed
how
men stand
side by side
in urinals,
trained in the
act,
looking straight
ahead;
the center fielder

wings it

into the
cut-off
man
who eyes the
runners;
the sun plunges
down
as somewhere
an old
woman
opens a window
looks at a
geranium,
goes for a cup of
water;

not much chance in

New York City

or

in the look
of the eye
of
the man
who sits in a
chair
across from
you

he is

going
to ask you
certain
questions about
certain
things


especially

about

what to

do

without

much chance.
