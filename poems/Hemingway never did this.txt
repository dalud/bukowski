I read that he lost a suitcase full of manuscripts on a train and that they never were recovered. I can't match the agony of this

but the other night I wrote a 3-page poem upon this computer
and through my lack of diligence and
practice
and by playing around with commands
on the menu
I somehow managed to erase the poem
forever.

believe me, such a thing is difficult to do even for a novice
but I somehow managed to do
it.

now I don't think this 3-pager was immortal but there were some crazy wild lines, now gone forever.
it bothers more than a touch, it's something like knocking over a good bottle of wine.

and writing about it hardly makes a good poem.
still, I thought somehow you'd like to
know?

if not, at least you've read this far

and there could be better work
down the line.

let's hope so, for your sake

and
mine.
