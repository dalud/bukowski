It's never quite right, he said, the way the people look, the way the music sounds, the way the words are written.
it's never quite right, he said, all the things we are

taught, all the loves we chase, all the deaths we
die, all the lives we live,
they are never quite right,
they are hardly close to right,
these lives we live
one after the other,
piled there as history,
the waste of the species,
the crushing of the light and the way,
it's not quite right,
it's hardly right at all
he said.

don't I know it? I

answered.

I walked away from the mirror.

it was morning, it was afternoon, it was
night

nothing changed

it was locked in place.
something flashed, something broke, something remained.

I walked down the stairway and

into it.
