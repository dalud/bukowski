I was a bum in San Francisco but once managed

to go to a symphony concert along with the well-dressed people

and the music was good but something about the audience was not
and something about the orchestra
and the conductor was
not,
although the building was fine and the
acoustics perfect
I preferred to listen to the music alone
on my radio
and afterwards I did go back to my room and I turned on the radio but
then there was a pounding on the wall:
"SHUT THAT GOD-DAMNED THING OFF!"

there was a soldier in the next room

living with his wife
and he would soon be going over there to protect me from Hitler so
I snapped the radio off and then heard his
wife say, "you shouldn't have done that."
and the soldier said, "FUCK THAT GUY!"
which I thought was a very nice thing for him
to tell his wife to do.
of course,
she never did.

anyhow, I never went to another live concert and that night I listened to the radio very quietly, my ear pressed to the

speaker.

war has its price and peace never lasts and millions of young men everywhere would die and as I listened to the classical music I heard them making love, desperately and mournfully, through Shostakovich, Brahms, Mozart, through crescendo and climax, and through the shared
wall of our darkness.
