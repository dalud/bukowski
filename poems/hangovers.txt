I've probably had about more of them

than any person alive
and they haven't killed me
yet
but some of those mornings felt
awfully near
death.

as you know, the worst drinking is done

on an empty stomach, while smoking

heavily and downing many different
types of
libations.

and the worst hangovers are when you

awaken in your car or in a strange room

or in an alley or in jail.

the worst hangovers are when you

awaken to realize that you have done

something absolutely vile, ignorant and

possibly dangerous the night before

but
you can't quite remember what it
was.

and you awaken in various states of

disorderâ€”parts of your body
damaged, your money missing
and/or possibly and often your
car, if you had one.

you might place a telephone call to

a lady, if you were with one, most

often to have her slam the phone

down on you.
or, if she is next to you then,

to feel her bristling and outrageous

anger.

drunks are never forgiven.

but drunks will forgive themselves

because they need to drink
again.

it takes an ungodly durability to

be a drinking person for many
decades.

your drinking companions are

killed by it.
you yourself are in and out of
hospitals
where the warning often is:
"One more drink will kill
you."
but
you beat that
by taking more than one more
drink.

and as you near three quarters of

a century in age
you find that it takes more and more

booze to get you
drunk.

and the hangovers are worse,

the recovery stage is

longer.

and the most remarkably stupid

thing is
that you are not unpleased that

you have done it
all
and that you are still
doing it.

I am typing this now

under the yoke of one of my
worst hangovers
while downstairs now
sit various and sundry
bottles of
alcohol.

it's all been so beastly

lovely,
this mad river,
this gouging
plundering
madness
that I would wish upon
nobody
but myself,
amen.
