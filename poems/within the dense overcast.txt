the Spaniards had it right and the Greeks had it right but
my grandmother, heavy with warts, was
confused.

Galileo did more than guess and

Salisbury became what?

the brightness of doom is anybody's

mess as
donkeys and camels are still put to
use.

Cleopatra would have loved

Canadian bacon and
nobody speaks of the
hills of Rome
anymore.

the curve ball curves

and vanilla icecream is always
overstocked.

600,000 people died in the

siege of Leningrad
and we got Shostakovich's
Seventh.

tonight there were gunshots

outside
and I sat and rubbed my

fingers across my greasy

forehead.

palaces, palaces,

and oceans with black
filthy
claws.

the shortest distance between

2 points is
often
intolerable.

who stuck the apple into the

pig's
mouth?
who plucked out his eyes
and baked him
like that?
Cassiodorus?
Cato?

the aviators of May

the buried dogs bones
the marshmallow kisses

the yellowed fleece of sound

the
tack
in the foot.

Virginia is slim.

Madeline is back.
Tina's on the gin.
Becky's on the phone.
don't
answer.


I see you in the closet.

I see you in the dark.

I see you dead.
I see you in the back of a

pick up truck on the
Santa Monica
freeway.
the perfect place to be
in the rain
is in the rain
walking toward a
farmhouse
at one thirty
a.m.
there is a lone light
in an upper
window.
it goes out.
a dog howls.

the nature of the dream is

best interpreted by the
dreamer.

the snail crawls home.

the toes under a blanket

is one of the most magical

sights
ever.

wood is frozen

fire.

my hand is my hand.

my hand is your hand.

the blue shot of

nerve.

Turgenev

Turgenev

the cloud walks toward

me

the pigeon speaks my

name.
