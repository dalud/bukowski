got a flat on the freeway

a.m. going north

I got over to the side

a small strip on the freeway edge

got out the jack and the spare

went to work

the big rigs going by blasts of air and noise

shaking everything and to top it

all
it was cold an icy wind

and I thought, Jesus Christ, mercy, can I do this thing?

this would be a good place to go crazy and chuck it all in


but I got the

new wheel
on,
the old one
in the trunk
and then I was

back in the
car

I gunned it into

the swirl of
traffic

and there I was

like nothing
had ever
happened

moving along

with everybody

else

all of us

caught up in our

petty larcenies
and our
rotting
virtues

I gunned it

hard
made the fast
lane

pushed the

button
as my radio
antenna

sliced into the

sky.
