have I gone the way of the deathly death?

will this machine finish me
where booze and women and poverty
have not?

is Whitman laughing at me from his grave?

does Creeley care?

is this properly spaced?

am I?

will Ginsberg howl?

soothe me!

get me lucky!

get me good!

get me going!

I am a virgin again.

a 70 year old virgin.

don't fuck me, machine

do.

who cares?

talk to me, machine!

we can drink together.

we can have fun.

think of all the people who will hate me at this computer.
we'll add them to the others
and continue right
on.

so this is the beginning

not the
end.
