after two-and-one-half bottles

that have not strengthened my saddened

heart

walking from this drunken

darkness
toward the bedroom
thinking of Hamsun who
ate his own flesh to
gain time to
write

I trundle into the other

room
an old
man

a hellfish in the night

swimming upward
sideways
down.
