when we were kids

there was a strange house
all the shades were
always
drawn
and we never heard voices
in there
and the yard was full of
bamboo
and we liked to play in
the bamboo
pretend we were
Tarzan
(although there was no
Jane).
and there was a
fish pond
a large one
full of the
fattest goldfish
you ever saw
and they were
tame.
they came to the
surface of the water
and took pieces of
bread
from our hands.

our parents had

told us:
"never go near that

house."

so, of course,
we went.

we wondered if anybody

lived there.
weeks went by and we

never saw
anybody.

then one day

we heard
a voice
from the house
"YOU GOD DAMNED
WHORE!"

it was a man's

voice.

then the screen

door
of the house was
flung open
and the man
walked
out.

he was holding a

fifth of whiskey
in his right
hand.
he was about
30.
he had a cigar
in his
mouth,
needed a
shave.

his hair was

wild and
uncombed
and he was
barefoot
in undershirt
and pants.
but his eyes
were
bright.
they blazed
with
brightness
and he said,
"hey, little
gentlemen,
having a good
time, I
hope?"

then he gave a

little laugh
and walked
back into the
house.

we left,

went back to my

parents' yard
and thought
about it.

our parents,

we decided,
had wanted us
to stay away
from there
because they

never wanted us

to see a man
like
that,

a strong natural

man
with
beautiful
eyes.

our parents

were ashamed

that they were
not
like that
man,
that's why they

wanted us
to stay
away.

but

we went back
to that house

and the bamboo

and the tame
goldfish.
we went back
many times
for many
weeks
but we never
saw
or heard
the man
again.


the shades were

down

as always
and it was
quiet.

then one day

as we came back from

school
we saw the
house.

it had burned

down,
there was nothing
left,
just a smoldering
twisted black
foundation
and we went to
the fish pond
and there was
no water
in it
and the fat
orange goldfish
were dead
there,
drying out.

we went back to

my parents' yard
and talked about
it
and decided that
our parents had
burned their
house down,
had killed

them

had killed the
goldfish
because it was
all too
beautiful,
even the bamboo
forest had
burned.
they had been
afraid of
the man with the
beautiful
eyes.

and

we were afraid
then
that

all throughout our lives

things like that
would
happen,
that nobody
wanted
anybody
to be
strong and
beautiful
like that,
that
others would never
allow it,
and that
many people
would have to
die.
