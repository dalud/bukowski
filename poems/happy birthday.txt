when Wagner was an

old man
a birthday party was given
in his
honor
and a couple of
youthful
incidental compositions
were played.

afterwards

he asked,
"who wrote those?"

"you did," he was

told.

"ah," he responded,

"it's as I have always
suspected: death
then
does have some
virtue."
