the big thrill

was being quite young and
reading Of Time and the
River
by Thomas Wolfe.
what a fat and wondrous
book!
I read it again and
again.

then a couple of decades

went by
and I read the book
again.

I disliked the poetic prose

right off.
I put the book down and
looked about the
room.

I felt cheated.

the thrill was gone.

I decided to leave town.

I was in Los Angeles.

two days later I was sitting on a

Greyhound bus

going to Miami.

and I had a pint of whiskey

in one pocket
and a paperback copy of

Fathers and Sons
in the
other.
