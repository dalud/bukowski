fine then, thunderclaps at midnight, death in the plaza.
my shoes need shining.
my typewriter is silent.

I write this in pen

in an old yellow
notebook
while
leaning propped up against the wall
behind the
bed.

Hemingway said, "it won't come

anymore."
later—the gun
into the
mouth.

not writing is not good

but trying to write
when you can't is
worse.

hey, I have excuses:

I have TB and the
antibiotics dull the
brain.

"you'll write again," people

assure me, "you'll be
better than

ever."

that's nice to know.

but the typewriter is silent
and it looks at
me.

meanwhile, every two or three

weeks
I get a fan letter in the mail
telling me that
surely
I must be
the world's greatest
writer.

but

the typewriter is silent
and looks at
me….

this is one of the

strangest times
of my
life.

I've got to do a

Lazarus
and I can't even
shine
my shoes.
