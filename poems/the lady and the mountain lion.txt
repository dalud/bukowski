it was hardly a wilderness area

but it was countryside
and there had been a paucity of
rainfallâ€”also some housing
construction on the
hillsides.

small game was dying

out.
the coyotes were the first of
the famished to
arrive
looking for
chickens
cats
anything.

in fact, a group attacked

a man on horseback
tearing his arm
but he
escaped.

then

in a park
there was the lady who
left her car to
go to the public
restroom.

she had closed the stall

door

when she heard a

soft
sound,
the stealth of
padded
feet.

then

as she sat there
the mountain lion stuck
his head under the
stall door.

a truly beautiful

animal.

then

the head withdrew, the cat
knocked over a trash can, circled,

emitted a slow
growl.

the lady climbed up

on the toilet
then grasped an overhead
pipe
and
swung herself completely up
(fear creates abnormal
acts) and sat where
she could watch
the cat.

at once

the cat put his
paws up
on the wash basin
stuck his head in

there

and lapped at a dripping
spigot.

then

he sank
low upon the floor
crouched
facing the doorway

then

zing
was gone
out of there.

then

at last
the lady began
screaming.

when the people

arrived
the cat was nowhere to be
seen.

the story made the

newspapers and the television

stations.

the story that won't be told is

that the lady
will never go to the bathroom

again
without thinking of a
mountain
lion.

a truly beautiful

animal.
