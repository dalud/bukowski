leaving for the track in the morning

my wife asks me,
"did you wring out your washrag
properly?"

"yes," I say.

"you never do," she says,

"it's important that you wring out
your washrag
properly."

I get into my car,

start it,
back out the drive.

of course, she's right, it is

important.
on the other hand
I don't want to get into an
argument over
washrags.

she waves goodbye,

I wave back,
then I turn left,
go down the hill.

it is a fine sunny

day
and great matters loom

across the horizon

of
history.

Carthage in my rearview

mirror,
I blend into
Time.
