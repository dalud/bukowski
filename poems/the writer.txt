when I think of the things I endured trying to be a writer—all those rooms in all those cities, nibbling on tiny bits of food that wouldn't keep a rat

alive.

I was so thin I could slice bread with my

shoulderblades, only I seldom had
bread…
meanwhile, writing things down
again and again
on pieces of paper.

and when I moved from one place to

another
my cardboard suitcase was just
that: paper outside stuffed with
paper inside.
each new landlady would
ask, "what do you
do?"

"I'm a writer."

"oh…"

as I settled into tiny rooms to evoke my

craft
many of them pitied me, gave me little
tidbits like apples, walnuts,
peaches…
little did they know

that that

was about all that I
ate.
but their pity ended when
they found cheap wine bottles in my
place.

it's all right to be a starving writer

but not
a starving writer who
drinks.
drunks are never forgiven
anything.

but when the world is closing in very

fast
a bottle of wine seems a very
reasonable friend.

ah. all those landladies,

most of them heavy, slow, their husbands long dead, I can still see those dears

climbing up and down the stairways of

their world.

they ruled my very existence:

without them allowing me
an extra week on the rent
now and then,
I was out on the
street

and I couldn't WRITE

on the street.
it was very important to have a
room, a door, those
walls.


oh, those dark mornings

in those beds
listening to their footsteps
listening to them cough
hearing the flushing of their
toilets, smelling the cooking of
their food
while waiting
for some word

on my submissions to New York City

and the world,
my submissions to those educated,

intelligent, snobbish, inbred,
formal, comfortable people
out there

they truly took their time to

say, no.

yes, in those dark beds

with the landladies rustling about
puttering and snooping, sharpening

utensils,
I often thought of those editors and

publishers out there
who didn't recognize
what I was trying to say
in my special
way

and I thought, they must be

wrong.

then this would be followed

with a thought much worse
than that:

I could be a

fool:

almost every writer thinks

they are doing
exceptional work.
that's
normal.

being a fool is

normal.

and then I'd

get out of bed
find a piece of
paper
and start
writing
again.
