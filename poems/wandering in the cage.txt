languid conjecture during hours of moil, trapped in the shadows of the father.
sidewalks outside of cafes are lonely
through the day.

my cat looks at me and is not sure what I am and I look back and am pleased to feel the same
about him…

reading 2 issues of a famous magazine of 40 years ago, the writing that I felt was bad then, I still feel
is
that way

and none of the writers have lasted.

sometimes there is a strange justice

working
somewhere.

sometimes

not…

grammar school was the first awakening of a long hell to come:
meeting other beings as horrible as my
parents.


something I never thought

possible…

when I won the medal for Manual of Arms in the R.O.T.C.
I wasn't interested in
winning.

I wasn't much interested in anything, even the girls seemed a bad game
to chase: all too much for all too
little

at night before sleeping I often considered what I would do, what I would be:

bank robber, drunk, beggar, idiot, common laborer.

I settled on idiot and common laborer, it seemed more comfortable than any of the alternatives…
the best thing about near-starvation and hunger is

that when you finally
eat
it is such a beautiful and delicious and
magical thing.

people who eat 3 meals a day throughout life have never really
tasted
food…

people are strange: they are constantly angered by trivial things,
but on a major matter
like
totally wasting their lives,
they hardly seem to
notice…

on writers: I found out that most of them swam together.
there were schools, establishments,
theories.
groups gathered and fought each
other.
there was literary politics.
there was game-playing and
bitterness.

I always thought writing was a

solitary profession.

still do…

animals never worry about

Heaven or Hell.

neither do

I.

maybe that's why

we
get along…

when lonely people come around

I soon can understand why
other people leave them
alone.

and that which would be a

blessing to
me

is a horror to

them…

poor poor Celine.

he only wrote one book.
forget the others.
but what a book it was:
Voyage au bout de la nuit.
it took everything out of
him.
it left him a hopscotch
odd-ball
skittering through the
fog of
eventuality…

the United States is a very strange

place: it reached its apex in
1970
and since then
for every year
it has regressed

years, until now in 1989 it is 1930

in the way of doing things.

you don't have to go to the movies

to see a horror
show.

there is a madhouse near the post office

where I mail my works
out.

I never park in front of the post office,

I park in front of the madhouse
and walk down.

I walk past the madhouse.

some of the lesser mad are allowed

out on the porch.
they sit like
pigeons.

I feel a brotherhood with

them.
but I don't sit with them.

I walk down and drop my works

in the first class slot.

I am supposed to know what I am

doing.

I walk back, look at them and

don't look at
them.

I get in my car and drive

off.

I am allowed to drive a

car.

I drive it all the way back to my

house.

I drive my car up the driveway,

thinking,
what am I doing?

I get out of my car

and one of my 5 cats walks up to

me, he is a very fine
fellow.


I reach down and touch

him.

then I feel all right.

I am exactly what I am supposed to

be.
