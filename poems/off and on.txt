at times I still consider coughing it up: gas pipe, 19th floor window, 3 fifths of whiskey in 4 hours or slamming at 85 mph into a slab of
concrete.

my first thought of suicide came at age 13 and it has

been with me ever since
through all the botched failures:
sometimes just rather playing at it, little minor
rehearsals;
other times
really trying like hell to
kill myself.

yet, now it's never totally intense, it's more like considering whether to go to a movie or not or whether to buy a new pair of
shoes.
actually, years go by and the suicidal thoughts
almost completely
abate.
then
suddenly
they return, like:
look here, baby, let's give it another
shot.

and when it returns it's fairly

compelling
but not so much in the mind (as in the old

days) but strangely, suicide waits in old little places, on the back of your neck or

at a spot just under the chin

or along the arms like the sleeves of a
sweater…
it used to hit the gut, now it's almost like
catching a
rash.

I will be driving along in my car with the radio on and it will leap at me and I will smile at it
remembering the old days
when those I knew thought that
my daring crazy acts stemmed from
bravery…

I will drive for several hours

up and down strange streets in
strange neighborhoods
at times
slowing down carefully
where children are playing in the
road.

I will park

go into cafes
drink coffee
read newspapers.
I will hear voices speaking of
ridiculous and dull
things.

I will be back in the car

driving along
and at once
everything will lift:
we all live in the same world:
I will have to pay my gas bill, get a
set of new reading glasses, I will need a

new tire

left rear
and I think I've been using my neighbor's garbage can.
it is fine to be normal again and
as I pull into the driveway
a large white moon smiles at me
through the windshield of
evening.

I brake, get out, close the car

door, centuries of sadness, gladness and

equilibrium will walk with me up to the door

as I put in the key
unlock it
walk into the place
once again having escaped the
inescapable, I will move toward the
kitchen cabinet for the
bottle
to
celebrate
that
or
whatever there is,
isn't,
will be,
won't
be—
like right
now.
