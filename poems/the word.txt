there was Auden, I don't remember

which small room I first read him
in

and there was Spender and I don't

know which small room
either
and then there was Ezra
and I remember that room,
there was a torn screen
that the flies came through
and it was Los Angeles
and the woman said to me,
"Jesus Christ, you reading those
Cantos again!"
she liked e. e. cummings, though,
she thought he was really
good and she was
right.

I remember when I read Turgenev,

though, I had just come out of the
drunk tank and I was living
alone
and I thought he was really a
subtle and funny son of a
bitch.

Hemingway I read everywhere,

sometimes a few times over
and he made me feel brave
and tough
until one day

it all just stopped cold for me

and worse than that,
Ernie became an
irritant.

my Jeffers period was sometime

in Los Angeles, some room, some

job,
the same woman was back
and she said,
"Jesus, how can you read this
crap?"
one time when she was gone
I found many magazines
under the bed.
I pulled them out

and found that the contents were

all about murder
and it was all about women
who were tortured, killed,
dismembered and so
forth with the
lurid photos
in black and
white.
that stuff wasn't for
me.

my first encounter with Henry

Miller was via paperback
on a bus through Arizona.
he was great when he stuck
to reality
but when he got ethereal
when he got to philosophizing
he got as dry and boring as
the passing
landscape.
I left him in the men's crapper

at a hamburger

stop.

I got hold of Celine's Journey

and read it straight through
while in bed eating crackers.

I kept reading, eating the
crackers and reading, reading,

laughing out loud,
thinking, at last I've met a man

who writes better than
I.
I finished the book and then
drank much water.
the crackers swelled up
inside of me
and I got the worst
god damned stomach
ache of my
life.

I was living with my first

wife.
she worked for the L.A.
Sheriff's Dept.
and she came in to
find me doubled up
and moaning.

"Oh, what happened?"

"I've just read the world's

greatest
writer!"

"But you said you were."


"I'm second, babyâ€¦"


I read F. D.'s Notes from the

Underground
in a small El Paso
library
after sleeping the night
on a park bench
during a sand
storm.
after reading that book
I knew I had a long way
to go as a
writer.

I don't know where I read

T. S. Eliot.
he made a small dent
which soon ironed
out.

there were many rooms,

many books,
D. H. Lawrence, Gorky,
A. Huxley, Sherwood
Anderson, Sinclair Lewis,
James Thurber, Dos Passos,

etc
Kafka.

Schopenhauer, Nietzsche,

Rabelais.
Hamsun.

as a very young man

I worked as a shipping clerk,

made the bars at
night,

came into the roominghouse,

went to bed

and read the

books.
I had 3 or 4 of them in
bed with me (what a
man!) and then I would
sleep.

my landlady finally told

me, "You know, you read those

books in bed and about every

hour or so one of them will
fall to the floor.
You are keeping everybody
awake!"

(I was on the 3rd floor.)

what days and nights those

were.

now I can't read anything,

not even the newspaper.
and, of course, I can't watch

tv except for the boxing
matches.
I do hear some news
on the car radio
while driving the freeway
and waiting for the
traffic
reports.

but you know, my former

life as a bibliophile, it
possibly kept me from
murdering somebody,
myself
included.

it kept me from being an

industrialist.
it allowed me to endure
some women

that most men would never

be able to live
with.
it gave me space, a
pause.
it helped me to write
this

(in this room,

like the other rooms)

perhaps for some young man

now
needing
to laugh at the
impossibilities
which are here
always
after we are
not.
