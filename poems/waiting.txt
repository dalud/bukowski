hot summers in the mid-30's in Los Angeles where every 3rd lot was vacant and it was a short ride to the orange

groves—
if you had a car and the
gas.

hot summers in the mid-30's in Los Angeles too young to be a man and too old to be a boy.

hard times.

a neighbor tried to rob our
house, my father caught him
climbing through the
window,
held him there in the dark
on the floor:
"you rotten son of a
bitch!"

"Henry, Henry, let me go,

let me go!"

"you son of a bitch, I'll kill

you!"

my mother phoned the police.

another neighbor set his house on fire

in an attempt to collect the

insurance.

he was investigated and
jailed.

hot summers in the mid-30's in Los Angeles, nothing to do, nowhere to go, listening to the terrified talk of our parents at night:

"what will we do? what will we
do?"

"god, I don't know…"

starving dogs in the alleys, skin taut

across ribs, hair falling out, tongues
out, such sad eyes, sadder than any sadness on earth.

hot summers in the mid-30's in Los Angeles, the men of the neighborhood were quiet and the women were like pale statues.

the parks full of socialists,

communists, anarchists, standing on the park benches, orating, agitating.

the sun came down through a clear sky and

the ocean was clean
and we were
neither men nor
boys.

we fed the dogs leftover pieces of dry hard bread
which they ate gratefully,
eyes shining in

wonder,

tails waving at such
luck

as

World War II moved toward us,
even then, during those

hot summers in the mid-30's in Los Angeles.
