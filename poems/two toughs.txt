at L.A. City College there were two toughs, me and Jed Anderson. Anderson was one of the best running backs in the

history of the school, a real breakaway threat anytime he got the football.

I was pretty tough physically but looked at sports as a game for freaks.
I thought a bigger game was challenging those
who attempted to teach
us.

anyhow, Jed and I were the two biggest lights on

campus, he piled up his 60, 70 and 80 yard
runs in the night games
and during the days
slouched in my seat
I made up what I didn't know
and what I did know
was so bad
many a teacher was made to
dance to it.

and one grand day

Jed and I
finally met.
it was at a little jukebox place
across from campus and
he was sitting with his
pals
and I was sitting with
mine.


"go on! go on! talk to him!"

my pals

urged.
I said, "fuck that gym
boy. I am one with
Nietzsche, let him come
over here!"

finally Jed got up to get a

pack of smokes from the
machine and one of my
friends asked,
"are you afraid of that
man?"

I got up and walked behind

Jed as he was reaching into the

machine
for his pack.

"hello, Jed," I

said.

he turned: "hello,

Hank."

then he reached into his

rear pocket,
pulled out a pint of
whiskey, handed it to
me.

I took a mighty hit,

handed it
back.

"Jed, what are you

going to do

after

L.A.C.C.?"

"I'm going to play

for Notre Dame."
then he walked back
to his table
and I walked back
to mine.

"what'd he say? what'd

he say?"

"nothing much."

anyhow, Jed never made it

to Notre Dame
and I never made it
anywhere
eitherâ€”
the years just swept us
away
but there were others
who went
on, including one fellow
who became a famous
sports columnist
and I had to look at his
photo
for decades
in the newspaper
as I inherited those
cheap rooms
and those roaches
and those airless
dreary
nights.

but

I was still proud of that moment

back then
when Jed handed me
that pint
and
I drained
a third of it
with all the disciples
watching.
damn, there was no way
it seemed
we could ever
lose
but we did.

and it took me

3 or 4 decades to
move on just a
little.
and Jed,
if you are still here
tonight,
(I forgot to tell you
then)
here's a thanks
for that drink.
