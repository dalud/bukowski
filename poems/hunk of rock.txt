Nina was the hardest of them

all,
the worst woman I had known
up to that moment
and I was sitting in front of
my secondhand black and white
tv
watching the news
when I heard a suspicious
sound in the kitchen
and I ran out there
and saw her with
a full bottle of whiskey—
a 5th—
and she had it and
was headed for the back porch
door
but I caught her and
grabbed at the bottle.
"give me that bottle, you
fucking whore!"
and we wrestled for the
bottle
and let me tell you
she gave me a good fight
for it
but
I got it away from her
and I told her to
get her ass out of
there.
she lived in the same place
in the back

upstairs.

I locked the door

took the bottle and a

glass
went out to the couch

sat down and
opened the bottle and

poured myself a good

one.

I shut off the tv and

sat there
thinking about what a

hard number
Nina was.
I came up with
at least
a dozen lousy things

she had done
to me.

what a whore.

what a hunk of rock.

I sat there drinking

the whiskey
and wondering
what I was doing
with Nina.

then there was a

knock on the
door.

it was Nina's friend,

Helga.


"where's Nina?"

she asked.

"she tried to steal

my whiskey, I
ran her ass
out of here."
"she said to meet
her here."

"what for?"

"she said me and her

were going to do it
in front of you
for $50."

"$25."

"she said $50."

"well, she's not

here…want a
drink?"

"sure…"

I got Helga a glass

poured her a
whiskey.
she took a
hit.

"maybe," she said,

"I ought to go get
Nina."


"I don't want to see

her."

"why not?"

"she's a whore."

Helga finished her

drink and I poured
her another.
she took a
hit.

"Benny calls me a

whore, I'm no
whore."

Benny was the guy

she was shacked
with.

"I know you're no

whore, Helga."

"thanks. Ain't ya got no

music?"

"just the radio…"

she saw it

got up
turned it
on.
some music came
blaring out.

Helga began to

dance

holding her whiskey

glass in one
hand.
she wasn't a good
dancer
she looked
ridiculous.

she stopped

drained her drink
rolled her glass along the

rug
then ran toward
me
dropped to her knees
unzipped me
and then
she was down
there
doing tricks.

I drained my

drink
poured another.

she was

good.
she had a college
degree
some place back
East.

"get it, Helga, get

it!"

there was a loud

knock
on the front

door.

"HANK, IS HELGA

THERE?"

"WHO?"

"HELGA!"

"JUST A MINUTE!"

"THIS IS NINA, I WAS

SUPPOSED TO MEET
HELGA HERE, WE HAVE A

LITTLE SURPRISE FOR

YOU!"

"YOU TRIED TO STEAL

MY WHISKEY, YOU

WHORE!"

"HANK, LET ME

IN!"

"get it, Helga, get

it!"

"HANK!"

"Helga, you fucking whore…

Helga! Helga! Helga!!"

I pulled away and

got up.

"let her in."

I went to the

bathroom.

when I came out they

were both sitting there

drinking and smoking

laughing about
something.
then they
saw me.

"50 bucks," said Nina.


"25 bucks," I said.

"we won't do it
then."

"don't then."

Nina inhaled

exhaled.
"all right, you
cheap bastard, 25
bucks!"

Nina stood up and

began taking her
clothes off.

she was the hardest

of them
all.

Helga stood up and

began taking her
clothes off.

I poured a

drink.
"sometimes I wonder

what the hell is
going on
around here," I
said.

"don't worry about

it, Daddy, just
get with it!"

"just what am I

supposed to
do?"
"just do
whatever the fuck
you feel
like doing,"
said Nina
her big ass
blazing
in the
lamplight.
