near the corner table in the

cafe
a middle-aged couple
sit.
they have finished their
meal
and they are each drinking a
beer.
it is 9 in the evening.
she is smoking a
cigarette.
then he says something.
she nods.
then she speaks.
he grins, moves his
hand.
then they are
quiet.
through the blinds next to
their table
flashing red neon
blinks on and
off.

there is no war.

there is no hell.

then he raises his beer

bottle.
it is green.
he lifts it to his lips,
tilts it.


it is a coronet.

her right elbow is

on the table
and in her hand
she holds the
cigarette
between her thumb and

forefinger
and
as she watches
him
the streets outside
flower
in the
night.
