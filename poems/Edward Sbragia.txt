puffing on tiny cigarette butts as the world washes to the

shore I
burn my
dumb lips
think of
Manfred Freiherr von Richthofen
und sein
Fliegerzirkus.

as my cat sits in the bathroom window I

light a new
stub

as Norway winks and the dogs of hell pray for me

downstairs my wife studies the

Italian
language.

up here

I would give half my ass for a
decent
smoke…

I

sneeze
then
jump: a little red coal of ash has dropped onto my
white white
belly—I
dig the fiery bit out with my

fingers:

a bit of minor
pain
I type naked: see my sulking soul
now
with a little pink
dot.

you see, I have my own show going on up here, I don't need Vegas or cable tv,
the label on my wine bottle states
in part:

"…our winemaker, Edward Sbragia, has retained the fresh, fruity character of the Pinot Noir and Napa Gamay grapes…"

the dogs of hell pray for me as the

world washes to the
shore.
