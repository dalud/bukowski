editor, critic, bigot, wit:

what do you expect of me
now that my youth has
flown and even my middle
age is
gone?

I expect what I've always

expected:
the hard-driven line
and a bit of help
from the
gods.

as the walls get closer

there should be more to
say
instead of
less.

each day is still a

hammer,
a flower.

editor, critic, bigot, wit:

the grave has no
mirror

and I am still this

machine
this paper
and all the

etceteras.
