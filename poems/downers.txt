some people

grind away
making their
unhappiness
the ultimate
factor
of their
existence
until
finally
they are
just
automatically
unhappy,
their
suspicious
upset
snarling
selves
grinding

on

and
at
and
for
and
through

their only

relief
being


to meet

another

unhappy

person
or
to
create
one.
