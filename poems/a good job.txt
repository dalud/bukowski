some jobs you like,

there is a clean gentle
feel to some of them,
like the one I had
unloading boxcars
of frozen
fish.

the fish came packed

in coffin-sized boxes,
beautifully
heavy and
almost
unyielding.
you had thick gloves
and a hook
and you gaffed the
damned thing
and pulled it along
the floor and slid it
outside and onto the
waiting
truck.

and strangely there

was no foreman,
they just turned us
loose in there
knowing we'd get
it done.


we were always

sending out one of

the fellows for another

bottle of
wine.
it was slippery and
cold in those
boxcars

we yanked out those

iced fish,
drank the wine
and the bullshit
flew.
there was a
fight or two
but nothing really
violent.

I was the peacemaker.

come on, fuck

that stuff!
let's get these
fish out of
here!

yeah!

then we'd be
laughing and
bullshitting
again.

toward evening

we all got quiet.
the fish seemed to
get heavier and
heavier.
shins got cracked,
knees

bruised

and the wine
settled heavily
into our
guts.
by the time you

got to your last box

you bullied it
out of there
strictly on nerve
alone.

when you punched

out
even the timecard

seemed
heavy.

and then you were

in your old car
moving toward
your place,
your shackjob,
wondering

whether good times

or hell
awaited
you.

but the frozen fish

you had
worked,
that thought was
pleasant and
soothing,

and you'd be back

for more,
hooking the wood

and dragging.

the night came

on and you flicked

the headlights
on

and the world was

good enough,
right
then.
