A. Huxley died at 69,

much too early for such a
fierce talent,
and I read all his
works
but actually
Point Counter Point
did help a bit
in carrying me through
the factories and the
drunk tanks and the
unsavory
ladies.
that
book
along with Hamsun's
Hunger
they helped a
bit.
great books are
the ones we
need.

I was astonished at

myself for liking the
Huxley book
but it did come from
such a rabid
beautiful
pessimistic
intellectualism,
and when I first

read P.C.P.

I was living in a
hotel room
with a wild and
crazy
alcoholic woman
who once threw
Pound's Cantos
at me
and missed,
as they did
with me.

I was working

as a packer
in a light fixture
plant
and once
during a drinking
bout
I told the lady,
"here, read this!"
(referring to
Point Counter
Point.)

"ah, jam it up

your ass!" she
screamed at
me.

anyhow, 69 seemed

too early for Aldous

Huxley to
die.
but I guess it's
just as fair
as the death of a

scrubwoman

at the same
age.

it's just that

with those who
help us
get on through,
then
all that light
dying, it works the
gut a bitâ€”
scrubwomen, cab drivers,

cops, nurses, bank
robbers, priests,
fishermen, fry cooks,
jockeys and the
like
be
damned.
