he wears the same pants

the same coat
the same shoes
day after day.

his shirttail hangs out.

his shoes are unlaced.
his hair is white and
uncombed.
he is balding.

he walks slowly to make his

bets, then
walks slowly back to his
seat.

he watches each race

without emotion.

he is hooked on nothing but

an impossibility.

he is so tired.

the old horseplayer.

the skies, the mountains,

music, nothing matters to
him.


he's hooked on an

impossibility.
