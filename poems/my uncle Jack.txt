my uncle Jack

is a mouse
is a house on fire
is a war about to begin
is a man running down the street with a knife in his back.

my uncle Jack

is the Santa Monica pier
is a dusty blue pillow
is a scratching black-and-white dog
is a man with one arm lighting a cigarette with one hand.

my uncle Jack

is a slice of burnt toast
is the place you forgot to look for the key

is the pleasure of finding 3 rolls of toilet paper in the closet is the worst dream you've ever had that you can't remember.

my uncle Jack

is the firecracker that went off in your hand
is your run-over cat dead outside your driveway at 10:30 a.m.
is the crap game you won in the Santa Anita parking lot

is the man your woman left you for that night in the cheap hotel room.

my uncle Jack

is your uncle Jack
is death coming like a freight train
is a clown with weeping eyes

is your car jack and your fingernails and the scream of the biggest mountain now.
