what I like about you

she told me
is that you're crudeâ€”
look at you sitting there
a beercan in your hand
and a cigar in your mouth
and look at
your dirty hairy belly
sticking out from
under your shirt.
you've got your shoes off
and you've got a hole
in your right stocking
with the big toe
sticking out.
you haven't shaved in
4 or 5 days.
your teeth are yellow
and your eyebrows
hang down
all twisted
and you've got enough
scars
to scare the shit
out of anybody.
there's always
a ring
in your bathtub
your telephone
is covered with
grease
and
half the crap in

your refrigerator is

rotten.
you never
wash your car.

you've got newspapers

a week old
on the floor.
you read dirty
magazines
and you don't have
a tv
but you order
deliveries from the
liquor store
and you tip
good.
and best of all
you don't push
a woman to
go to bed
with you.
you seem hardly
interested

and when I talk to you

you don't
say anything
you just
look around
the room or
scratch your
neck
like you don't
hear me.
you've got an old
wet towel in
the sink
and a photo of
Mussolini
on the wall

and you never

complain
about anything
and you never
ask questions
and I've
known you for

months but I have no idea who you are. you're like some

pulled down shade but that's what

I like about you:
your crudeness: a woman can drop

out of your life and forget you real fast. a woman
can't go anywhere but UP
after leaving you, honey. you've got to be

the best thing that ever happened to
a girl
who's between one guy

and the next

and has nothing

to do
at the moment.

this fucking
Scotch is
great.
let's play
Scrabble.
