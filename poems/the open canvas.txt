listening to organ music on the radio

tonight,
the door to the small balcony is
open,
it is 11:07 p.m., cold, a night of
silence except for the
radio, the
organ music,
and I get this vision
of a thin, tall man at the keyboard,
he is more than pale, almost
chalky white.

the music boils in the gloom.

the walls about him are unpainted, cold, austerely indifferent.



full glass of wine sits untouched

on a rough hand-made table to his

right.

the music seeps through his

bones,
centuries bend and
unwind as the invisible dog
of darkness
walks by

in a half circle

behind him,
then blends into
neurons.
the man continues to
play.
the world turns upsidedown
with a fixed gentleness
but the walls, the man,
the sounds continue
as before.

then the world returns to its

natural course.

one tonality breeds

another.
the sounds of black strings
of beads.
the sound is one
yet not one.

then the music

stops.

the man sits.

he is thoughtless.

the keys of the organ assume

an immensity.

the walls about him move away

faster than the eye
can note,
then they
return.


the man coughs, looks to

his left,
looks down,
touches the keys and
is taken
again.
