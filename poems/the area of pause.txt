you have to have it or the walls will close in.
you have to give everything up, throw it
away, everything away.
you have to look at what you look at
or think what you think
or do what you do
or
don't do
without considering personal
advantage
without accepting guidance.

people are worn away with

striving,
they hide in common
habits.
their concerns are herd
concerns.

few have the ability to stare

at an old shoe for
ten minutes
or to think of odd things
like who invented the
doorknob?

they become unalive

because they are unable to
pause
undo themselves
unkink

unsee

unlearn
roll clear.

listen to their untrue

laughter, then
walk
away.
