what I liked about e. e. cummings

was that he cut away from
the holiness of the
word
and with charm
and gamble
gave us lines
that sliced through the
dung.

how it was needed!

how we were withering
away
in the old
tired
manner.

of course, then came all

the
e. e. cummings
copyists.
they copied him then
as the others had
copied Keats, Shelley,
Swinburne, Byron, et
al.

but there was only

one
e. e. cummings.
of course.

one sun.

one moon.

one poet,

like
that.
