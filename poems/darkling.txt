some nights you don't sleep.

of course
having 3 or 4 cats on the bed
doesn't help.
my wife likes to carry them up
from downstairs
but
it's not always the cats, it's
hardly anything,
say,
re-working horse systems in my
brain, or it's a cold moon, an
itchy back, the
thought of death out
there
beyond the venetian blinds
or
I'll think nice things about my
wife, she looks so small there
under the blanket, a little
lump, that's all
(death, you take me first, please,
this lady needs a gentle space of
peace
without me).

then a boat horn blows from the

harbor.
I pull my head up, stretching
my thick neck, I see the
clock:
3:36 a.m.

that always does it: looking at

the clock.
by 3:45 a.m. I am asleep, just

like the cats, just like my
wife,

the venetian blinds closing us

all in.
