another still, hot summer night,

the small insects circle my wineglass, my winebottle.

I once again consider my death

as a Brahms symphony ends upon the
radio.

the horses didn't run today (not

here) but there was gunfire, murder,
bombings in many parts of the
earth.
there is always a contest
of sorts
at hand.

and the years move slow and the years

move fast and the years move
past.

it seems not so long ago that

old Henry Miller was still
alive,
always finding new young girls to dust

his lampshades, pose for him, and make him nice little meals.
what a ladies' man, he could never get
enough of them.

anyhow, my 5 cats dislike the heat, they

sit outside under the cool juniper bushes
listening to me

type.

sometimes they bring me presents:
birds or mice.

then we have a little misunderstanding.

and they back off
looking at me
and their eyes say: this guy's nuts,
he doesn't know that this is the way
it works.

another hot summer night as I sit here

and play at being a writer
again.
and the worst thing
of course
is that the words will never
truly break through for any of
us.

some nights I have taken the sheet

out of the typer and
held it over the cigarette
lighter, flicked
it and waited for the
result.

"Hank, are you burning things again?"

my wife will ask.

anyhow, there's another composer on the radio now
and there is only so much he can do
with his notes.
I am proud for him and yet
sad for him too.

the radio is old and dusty

and through

the speaker

he talks to me.

it's as if he were hiding in there

and I want to console him, say:
"I am sorry, poor fellow, but
creation has its
limits."

another hot summer night

another sheet of paper in this machine,

more insects, more cigarettes in
this place, this time, hurrah hurrah, lost

in the grisly multitude of days
the speaker in the radio vibrates, trembles as the composer swells out at me, the son of a bitch is good
so brave despite his limitations
as the cats wait under the juniper

bushes and I pour more wine, more wine, more wine.
