the tragedy-sniffers are all

about.
they get up in the morning
and begin to find things
wrong
and they fling themselves
into a rage about
it,
a rage that lasts until
bedtime,
where even there
they twist in their
insomnia,
not able to rid their
minds
of the petty obstacles
they have
encountered.

they feel set against,

it's a plot.
and by being constantly
angry they feel that
they are constantly
right.

you see them in traffic

honking wildly
at the slightest
infraction,
cursing,
spewing their

invectives.

you feel them

in lines
at banks
at supermarkets
at movies,
they are pressing
at your back
walking on your
heels,

they are impatient to

a fury.

they are everywhere

and into
everything,
these violently
unhappy
souls.

actually they are

frightened,
never wanting to be

wrong
they lash out
incessantlyâ€¦
it is a malady
an illness of
that
breed.

the first one

I saw like that
was my
father


and since then

I have seen a

thousand
fathers,
ten thousand
fathers
wasting their lives

in hatred,
tossing their lives

into the
cesspool
and
ranting
on.
