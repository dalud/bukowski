I suppose Jr. High was the worst.

my friend Teddy began going to
various dances
and talking about it all.
his father loaned him the car
for these
functions.

he also had a new wrist watch.

it was still the depression
era and few of us boys
had wrist
watches.

Teddy kept lifting up his wrist

and looking at his
watch.
he did it 3 or 4 times
within a ten minute
period.

"why the hell do you keep

looking at the time?
you going
somewhere?"

"maybe, maybe…"

"well, go on then…"


"she kissed me at the

doorway, I can still feel her

lips!"

"whose lips?"

"Annabell's, she kissed me
at her door after the
dance!"

"listen, Teddy, let's go down to the

lot and get up a
baseball game."

"I can't get her out of my mind.

her lips were soft,
warm…"

"Christ, man, who

cares?"

"I bought her a corsage for

the dance, she looked so
beautiful…"

"didn't you slip her any

turkey neck?"

"what?

listen, I'm in love!"

"well, that's what you do

then before somebody
else slams her."

"don't talk that way, I'm

warning you!"


"I can take you, Teddy,

with one ball tied behind

my back."

he looked at his watch:

"I gotta go now…"
"gonna go play with yourself,

Teddy?"

"look who's talking!

you don't even have a
girl!"

"you don't know what I

have."

"you've got nothing but

your hand."

"I've got two hands, Teddy."

I grabbed him by the shirt and

pulled him in
close.

"and just for laughs I just might

kick your ass, real
good."

"you're just pissed because

you've got
nobody!"

I let him go.

"get out of here…"


Teddy turned and

walked off.

he'd gotten off easy that

time.
next time I'd kick his ass
from stem to
stern.
it was 1935.

I was standing in my parents'

back yard.
it was a Saturday
afternoon.

my father was in the house

listening to the radio,
the Trojans were playing
Notre Dame.
my mother was in there
doing something and
nothing.

I walked in through the back

door.
my mother was in the
kitchen.

"Henry, I saw Teddy

leaving.
he's a nice
boy."

"yeah…"

"I saw Teddy

all dressed up to go to
the dance.
he looked so
nice!"

"yeah…"

"Henry, when are you going

to get a nice girl to take to
a dance?"

"I only dance with them in

bed!"
"YOU DON'T TALK THAT WAY
TO YOUR MOTHER!"

it was my father.

he had been standing there.
it must have been half
time.

"don't bother me," I

said.

"I'LL BOTHER YOU, I'LL BOTHER YOU SO YOU'LL NEVER TALK THAT WAY AGAIN!"

"is that right, old man?

come on then, bother
me!"

he stood there.

I stood there.

nothing happened.

"ALL RIGHT," he screamed,

"GO TO YOUR ROOM!
NOW!"


I walked past him, on through

the house and out the

door.

I walked down the street.

I had no money, I had nowhere to

go.
I just kept
walking.

it was a hot summer day

and I just kept walking,
3 blocks, 4 blocks, 5
blocks…

then I passed a mongrel dog

going the other
way.

his fur was matted and dirty

and his tongue hung out of
one side of his
mouth.

I stopped, turned and watched

him trot
off.

then I faced the other way and

continued my
journey.
