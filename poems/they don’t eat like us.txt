my father eating.

his ears moved.

he munched with great vigor.

I wished him in hell.

I watched the fork in his hand.

I watched it put food into his mouth.

the food I ate was tasteless and deadly.

his small bits of conversation entered my head.
the words ran down my spine.
they spilled into my shoes.

"eat your food, Henry," my mother said.

he said, "many people are starving and don't eat as well as us!"


I wished him in hell.

I watched his fork.
it gathered more food and put it into his mouth.
he chewed in a dog-like fashion.
his ears moved.

the brutal beatings he gave me I was ready for.

but watching him eat brought on the darkness.
there at the tablecloth.
there with the green and blue wooden napkin holders.

"eat your food or I'll strop your god damned ass," he told me.


later in life I made him pay somewhat.

but he still owes me.

and I'll never collect.
