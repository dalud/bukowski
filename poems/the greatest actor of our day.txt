he's getting fatter and fatter,

almost bald
he has a wisp of hair
in the back
which he twists
and holds
with a rubber band.

he's got a place in the hills

and he's got a place in the
islands
and few people ever see
him.
some consider him the greatest
actor of our
day.

he has few friends, a

very few.
with them, his favorite
pastime is
eating.

at rare times he is reached

by telephone
usually
with an offer to act
in an exceptional (he's
told)
motion picture.


he answers in a very soft

voice:

"oh, no, I don't want to

make any more movies…"

"can we send you the
screenplay?"

"all right…"

then

he's not heard from
again.

usually

what he and his few friends

do
after eating
(if the night is cold)
is to have a few drinks
and watch the screenplays

burn
in the fireplace.

or

after eating (on
warm evenings)
after a few
drinks
the screenplays
are taken
frozen
out of cold
storage.
he hands some
to his friends
keeps some
then
together

from the veranda

they toss them
like flying saucers
far out
into the spacious
canyon
below.

then

they all go
back in
knowing
instinctively
that the screenplays
were
bad. (at least,
he senses it and
they
accept
that.)

it's a real good

world
up there:

well-earned, self-sufficient

and
hardly
dependent
upon the
variables.

there's

all that time
to eat
drink
and
wait on death
like

everybody

else.
