the interviewers come around

and there is nothing that you can
really
tell them.

it's

embarrassing
and the easiest way out
is to get yourself
and them
drunk.

sometimes there is also a

camera man and a sound
man
and so it becomes a
party with
many bottles
needed.

I don't think they want to

hear the literary crap
either.

it seems to work out all

right:
I get letters
later:

"I really had a good

timeâ€¦"

or: "it was the best time

I ever had."

how strange, when all I

remember
of any particular night is

saying goodbye at the

door
with: "don't leave

anything behind so you

have to
come back."
