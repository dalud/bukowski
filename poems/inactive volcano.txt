the bartender at Musso's

remembers me when
was in rags, used to

lean on the wood with the

worst and loudest of women

and
we would drink too much spill our drinks get

nasty.

now

I enter
quietly with an
interviewer
a film director
or some
actor
or
with my wife
and a gentle
friend or
two.

at times

now
I see the bartender

looking at me

and I know
he's thinking
of back then
the way it
was
and I look
back at him
and my eyes
send the
message:
I'm just the

same, friend, only

the circumstances

have
altered
but
I'm
the same.

then I

turn back
to
whomever
I am with
and they
too
seem to be
thinking,
when is he
going to go
crazy
again?

nothing

to do,
friend,
but

wait

and

see.
