they were all out on the front porch

talking:
Hemingway, Faulkner, T. S. Eliot,

Ezra Pound, Hamsun, Wally Stevens,

e. e. cummings and a few others.

"listen," said my mother, "can't you

ask them to stop talking?"

"no," I said.

"they are talking garbage," said my

father, "they ought to get
jobs."

"they have jobs," I

said.

"like hell," said my

father.

"exactly," I

said.

just then Faulkner came

staggering in.
he found the whiskey in the
cupboard and went outside with
it.


"a terrible person,"

said my mother.

then she got up and peeked out

on the porch.
"they've got a woman with them,"

she said, "only she looks like a
man."

"that's Gertrude," I

said.

"there's another guy flexing his

muscles," she said, "he claims he

can whip any three of
them."

"that's Ernie," I said.

"and he," my father pointed to me,

"wants to be like them!"

"is that true?" my mother asked.

"not like them," I said, "but of

them."

"you get a god-damned job,"

said my father.

"shut up," I said.

"what?"

"I said, â€˜shut up,' I am listening to

these men."


my father looked at his wife:

"this is no son of

mine!"

"I hope not," I said.

Faulkner came staggering into the room

again.
"where's the telephone?" he
asked.

"what the hell for?" my father

asked.

"Ernie's just blown his brains

out," he said.

"you see what happens to men like

that?" screamed my father.

I got up

slowly
and helped Bill find
the
telephone.
