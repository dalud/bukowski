that as the yellow shade rips

as the cat leaps wild-eyed
as the old bartender leans on the wood
as the hummingbird sleeps

you know and I know and thee know

as the tanks practice on false battlefields

as your tires work the freeway
as the midget drunk on cheap bourbon cries alone at night as the bulls are carefully bred for the matadors

as the grass watches you and the trees watch you as the sea holds creatures vast and true

you know and I know and thee know

the sadness and the glory of two slippers under a bed

the ballet of your heart dancing with your blood
young girls of love who will someday hate their mirrors

overtime in hell
lunch with sick salad

you know and I know and thee know

the end as we know it now

it seems such a lousy trick after the lousy agony but

you know and I know and thee know

the joy that sometimes comes along out of nowhere rising like a falcon moon across the impossibility


you know and I know and thee know

the cross-eyed craziness of total elation

we know that we finally have not been cheated you know and I know and thee know

as we look at our hands our feet our lives our way the sleeping hummingbird the murdered dead of armies
the sun that eats you as you face it

you know and I know and thee know

we will defeat death.
