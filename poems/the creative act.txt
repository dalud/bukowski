for the broken egg on the floor

for the 5th of July
for the fish in the tank
for the old man in room 9
for the cat on the fence

for yourself

not for fame

not for money

you've got to keep chopping

as you get older

the glamour recedes

it's easier when you're young

anybody can rise to the

heights now and then

the buzzword is

consistency

anything that keeps it

going

this life dancing in front of

Mrs. Death.
