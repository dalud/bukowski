in the bottom of the hour

lurks
the smoking claw
the red train
the letter home
the deep-fried blues.

in the bottom of the hour

lurks
the song you sang together
the mouse in the attic
the train window in the rain
the whiskey breath on grandfather
the coolness of the jail trustee.

in the bottom of the hour

lurks
the famous gone quite stupid
churches with peeling white paint
lovers who chose hyenas
schoolgirls giggling at atrophy
the suicide oceans of night.

in the bottom of the hour

lurks
button eyes in a cardboard face
dead library books squeezed upright.
in the bottom of the hour
lurks
the octopus

Gloria gone mad while shaving her armpits the gang wars

no toilet paper at all in a train station restroom a flat tire halfway to Vegas. in the bottom of the hour
lurks

the dream of the barmaid as the perfect girl the first and only home run

the father sitting in the bathroom with the door open the brave and quick death
the gang rape in the Fun House.

in the bottom of the hour

lurks
the wasp in the spider web
the plumbers moving to Malibu

the death of the mother like a bell that never rang the absence of wise old men.

in the bottom of the hour

lurks
Mozart

fast food joints where the price of a bad meal exceeds the hourly wage angry women and deluded men and faded children the housecat
love as a swordfish.

in the bottom of the hour

lurks
17,000 people screaming at a homerun
millions laughing at the obvious jokes of a tv comedian
the long and hideous wait in the welfare offices
Cleopatra fat and insane
Beethoven in the grave.
in the bottom of the hour
lurks
the damnation of Faust and sexual intercourse
the sad-eyed dogs of summer lost in the streets
the last funeral
Celine failing again

the carnation in the buttonhole of the kindly killer.

in the bottom of the hour
lurks
fantasies tainted with milk
our obnoxious invasion of the planets
Chatterton drinking rat poison

the bull that should have killed Hemingway Paris like a pimple in the sky.

in the bottom of the hour

lurks
the mad writer in a cork room
the falseness of the Senior Prom
the submarine with purple footprints.

in the bottom of the hour

lurks
the tree that cries in the night
the place that nobody found

being so young you thought you could change it being middle-aged and thinking you could survive it being old and thinking you could hide from it.

in the bottom of the hour

lurks
2:30 a.m.
and the next to last line
and then the last.
