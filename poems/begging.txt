like most of you, I've had so many jobs that I feel as if I were gutted and my insides thrown to the winds.
I've met some good people along the
way and also the
other kind.
yet when I think of all those
I have worked with—
even though decades have passed—
Karl
comes to mind
first.

I remember Karl: our jobs required we

both wear aprons
tied from behind and around
the neck with string.

I was Karl's underling.

"we got an easy job," he
told me.

each day as one by one our superiors arrived Karl would make a slight bend at the waist, smile, and with a nod of the head greet each: "good morning Dr. Stein,"
or, "good morning Mr. Day" or

Mrs. Knight or if the lady was unattached "good morning, Lilly" or Betty or Fran.

never spoke.


Karl seemed concerned at this and

one day he took me aside: "hey,
where the fuck else you going to get a
two hour lunch like we
do?"

"nowhere, I guess…"

"well, o.k., look, for guys like you and me, this is as good as it can get, this is all there is."

I waited.

"so look, it's hard to suck up to them at first, it didn't come easy for me
but after a while I realized that it
didn't matter.
I just grew a shell.
now I've got my shell, got
it?"

I looked at him and sure enough he did look like he had a shell, there was a mask-like look to his

face and the eyes were null, void and undisturbed; I was looking at a weathered and beaten conch.

some weeks went by.

nothing changed: Karl bowed and scraped and smiled

undaunted, perfect in his
role.
that we were perishable, perhaps didn't occur to
him
or
that greater gods might be

watching.

I did my

work.
then, one day, Karl took me
aside again.

"listen, Dr. Morely spoke to me

about you."

"yes?"

"he asked me what was wrong with

you."

"what did you tell

him?"

"I told him that you were

young."

"thanks."

upon receiving my next check, I

quit

but

still

had to
eventually settle for another similar

job
and
viewing the
new Karls
I finally forgave them all
but not myself:


being perishable sometimes makes a

man
strange
almost
unemployable
most
obnoxious—
no servant of
free
enterprise.
