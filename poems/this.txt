self-congratulatory nonsense as the

famous gather to applaud their seeming

greatness

you

wonder where
the real ones are

what

giant cave
hides them

as

the deathly talentless
bow to
accolades

as

the fools are
fooled
again

you

wonder where
the real ones are

if there are

real ones.

this

self-congratulatory nonsense

has lasted

decades
and
with some exceptions

centuries.

this
is so dreary

is so absolutely pitiless

it

churns the gut to
powder
shackles hope

it

makes little things
like
pulling up a shade
or
putting on your shoes
or

walking out on the street

more difficult

near
damnable

as

the famous gather to
applaud their
seeming
greatness

as

the fools are
fooled
again


humanity

you sick
motherfucker.
