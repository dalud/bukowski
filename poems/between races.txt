I know that I'm not supposed to bother

you, he said.

you've got that right, I

answered.

but, he went on, I want to tell you

that I was up all night
reading your
latest book.
I've read all your
books.
I work in the
post office.

oh, I said.

and I want to interview you for

our newspaper.

no, I said, no

interview.

why? he asked.

I'm tired of interviews, they have

nothing to do with
anything.

listen, he went on, I'll make it

easy for you, I'll come to your

house or I'll buy you dinner at

Musso's.

no, thank you, I said.

look, the interview isn't really for

our paper, it's for
me, I'm a writer and I want to get

out of the post
office.

listen, I said, just pull up a chair

and sit down at your
typewriter.

no interview? he asked.

no, I answered.

he walked

off.

they were coming out on the track

for the next race.

talking to the young man had

made me feel
bad.

they thought that writing had

something to do with
the politics of the
thing.

they were simply not

crazy enough
in the head
to sit down to a

typer

and let the words bang

out.

they didn't want to

write
they wanted to
succeed at
writing.

I got up to make

my bet.

no use letting a little

conversation
ruin your
day.
