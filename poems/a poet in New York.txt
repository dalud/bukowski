eating out tonight

I find a table alone
and while waiting for my order
take out my wife's copy of
A Poet in New York.
I often carry things to read
so that I will not have to look at
the people.

I find the poems bad (for me)

these poems written in 1929
the year of the stock market
crash.

I close the book and look at

the people.

my order arrives.

the food is bad too.

some say that bad and good

run in streaks.

I hope so.

I wait for the good, put a slice of
lemon chicken into my
mouth, chew
and pretend that everything is
fairly
fine.
