come on, let's go see him, this old guy is a kick in the ass, 50 years old, he sits around in his shorts and underwear

drinking wine out of this chipped white
cup.
he sits with the shades pulled down and
he's never owned a tv set.
the only time he goes out is for more
wine
or to the racetrack in his baby blue
'58 Comet.

you get there and he's distraught, some woman has always left forever and
he pretends to play it with bravado but
his little slit eyes are filled with
pain.

he'll pour drinks all around, he just gulps that crap down and then sometimes he'll get up and puke.
it's really something. you
can hear him for blocks.
then he'll come out and pour another
drink.
he'll go on and on drinking

and then once in a while he'll say something

crazy like, "anything 3 dogs can do, 4 dogs

can do better!"
other things too.
or he'll smash a glass or a bottle against
the wall.


he worked as an orderly in a

hospital for 15 years
then quit.
he never sleeps at night.

and for a guy that ugly

I don't see how he gets all his
women.
and he's jealous.
just look at one of his women
and he'll swing on you.

then he gets drunk and tells crazy

stories and sings.
and guess what? he writes
poetry.

come on, let's go see him, this old guy

is a kick in the
ass!
