Fred, they called him.

he always sat at the end of the
bar
near the doorway
and he was always there
from opening to
closing.
he was there more than
I was,
which is saying
something.

he never talked to

anybody.
he just sat there
drinking his glasses of
draft beer.
he looked straight ahead
right across the bar
but he never looked at
anybody.

and there's one other

thing.

he got up

now and then
and went to the
jukebox
and he always played the
same record:
Bonaparte's Retreat.


he played that song

all day and all night
long.
it was his song,
all right.

he never got tired

of it.

and when his draft beers

really got to him
he'd get up and play
Bonaparte's Retreat
6 or 7 times
running.

nobody knew who he was or

how he made
it,
only that he lived in a
hotel room
across the street

and was the first customer

in the bar
each day
as it
opened.

I protested to Clyde

the bartender:
"listen, he's driving us
crazy with that
thing.
eventually, all the other
records are
rotated
but

Bonaparte's Retreat

remains.
what does it
mean?"

"it's his song,"

said Clyde.
"don't you have a
song?"

well, I came in about one

p.m. this day
and all the regulars
were there
but Fred wasn't
there.

I ordered my drink,

then said out loud,
"hey, where's
Fred?"

"Fred's dead,"

said Clyde.

I looked down at the end

of the bar.
the sun came through the

blinds
but there was nobody
at the end
stool.

"you're kidding me,"

I said, "Fred's back in the

crapper or
something."


"Fred didn't come in this

morning," said Clyde, "so

I went over to his
hotel room
and there he
was
stiff as a
cigar
box."
everybody was very
quiet.
those guys never said
much
anyhow.

"well," I said, "at least

we won't have to hear
Bonaparte's Retreat
anymore."

nobody said

anything.

"is that record

still in the
juke?" I
asked.

"yes," said

Clyde.

"well," I said,

"I'm going to play it
one more time."

I got up.

"hold it,"

said Clyde.

he came around the bar,

walked to the
juke
box.

he had a little key

in his
hand.
he put the key
in the juke
and opened
it.

he reached in

and pulled
out a
record.

then he took the

record and
broke it over
his
knee.

"it was his

song," said
Clyde.

then he locked

the juke,
took the broken
record
behind the bar
and
trashed

it.

the name of the

bar
was
fewel's.
it was at
Crenshaw and

Adams
and it's not
there
anymore.
