he sat in the kitchen at the breakfastnook table reading the manuscripts writing a short rejection on each replacing the paperclip then sliding the pages back into the brown

manila envelopes.

he'd been reading for an hour and thirty-five minutes and hadn't found a single poem

well he'd have to do the usual thing

for the next issue: write the poems himself and make up names for the authors.

where was the talent?

for the last 3 decades the poets had

flattened
out it was like reading stuff
from a house of
subnormals.

but

he'd save Rabowski
for last

Rabowski had sent 8 or ten poems in a batch but always there were one or two good ones.

he sighed and pulled out the Rabowski

poems.


he slowly read them he finished

he got up went to the refrigerator

got out
a can of beer cracked it sat back
down

he read the poems all over again they were all bad even Rabowski had crapped out.

the editor got out a printed rejection slip

wrote "you must have had a bad
week."
then he slipped the poems back into the
manila envelope sealed it tossed it
on top of the pile for mailing

then he took the beer sat down next to his wife on the couch

she was watching Johnny Carson

he watched

Carson was bad Carson knew he was bad but he couldn't do anything about it.



the editor got up with his can of beer and began walking up the stairway.



"where are you going?" his wife

asked.

"to bed to sleep."


"but it's early."

"god damn it I know that!"

"well you needn't act that way

about it!"
he walked into the bedroom flicked on
the wall switch
there was a small bright flash and then
the overhead light burned
out.

he sat on the edge of the bed and finished his

beer in the
dark.
