dumb,

Jesus Christ,
some people are so dumb
you can hear them
splashing around
in their dumbness
as their eyes
look out of their
heads.
they have
most of their
parts: hands, feet,
ears, legs, elbows,
intestines, fingernails,
noses and so
forth
but
there's nothing
there
yet
they are able to
speak,
form sentencesâ€”
but what
comes out
of their mouths
are the stalest
concepts, the most
warped beliefs,
they are the repository
of all the obvious
stupidities
they have

stuffed

themselves
with
and it hurts me
to
look at them
to
listen to them,
I want to
run and hide
I want to
escape their engulfing

nullity

there is no

horror movie
worse,
no murder
as
unsolved

but

the world
goes on
and
they
go on

dumbly

slamming
my guts to
pieces.
