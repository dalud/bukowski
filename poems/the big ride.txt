all right,

some day you'll see me in a plastic
helmet, long stockings,
double-lens goggles;
I'll be tooling along on my 10-speed
bike on the promenade,
my face will be as intense
as a canteloupe and
in my knapsack
there could be a
bible, along with the
liverwurst sandwich and
the red red
apple.

off to one side the

sea will break and
break
and I will
pump alongâ€”a
well-lived
man,
lived a little, perhaps,
beyond his
sensibilities: too
much hair in the
ears, and face
badly shaven;
there, my lips
never again to
kiss a
virgin; I gulp in

the salty air

while being
unsure of the
time
but almost sure
of the
place.

all right, gliding

along
girding up for the
casket,
the sun like a
yellow glove to
grab me
I pass a group of
young ones
sitting in their
convertible.

"Jesus Christ," I hear

a voice, "do you
know who that
was?"

was?

was?

why, you little

fart bells!
you bits of
bunny
droppings!

I kick it

into high, I
rise over a
hill

into a patch

of fog,
my legs
pump and
the
sea
breaks.
