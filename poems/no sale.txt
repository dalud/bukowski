I just sat in the bar

non compos mentis.

it was about a week before

Xmas.
big Ed was selling trees
outside.

he came into the

bar.

"Jesus, it's freezing out

there!"

big Ed looked at me.

"Hank, you go stand out there

with the trees.
if anybody wants to buy
one, you come in and
get me."

I stood outside.

I was in my shirt sleeves.

I didn't have a coat.
it was snowing.
it was ice cold
but a nice ice
cold.
I wasn't used to snow

but I liked the snow.

I stood with the trees.

I stood there about 20

minutes
then big Ed came
out.

"nobody come by?"

"no, Ed."

"you go on in, tell Billy Boy

to give you a drink on
my tab."

I walked in

got a stool.

I told Billy Boy,

"double scotch and water,

Ed's tab."

Billy Boy poured.

"you sell any trees?"

"no trees."

Billy Boy looked at

the patrons.

"hey, Hank didn't sell

no trees."


"whatsa matter, Hank?"

somebody asked.

I didn't answer.

I took a hit of my
drink.

"how come no trees were

sold?" somebody else
asked.
"as the bee swarms to
honey, as night follows
day
in the stink of time,
it will
happen."

"what will happen?"

"somebody will sell a tree

though it won't necessarily

be me."

I finished my drink.

there was

silence.

then somebody said,

"this guy is some kind of
nut."

being there

with those
decided
had no argument

with

that.
