Rossini, Mozart and Shostakovich

are who I will hear tonight

after reading about the death of Red Grange.
my wife and I ate at a Japanese restaurant tonight and I told her that Red Grange had died. I had red bean ice cream for dessert.
my wife declined.
the war was still on in the Gulf.
we got into the car and I drove us back here.
now I am listening to Rossini
who died before Red Grange.
now the audience is applauding.
now the players are readying for Mozart.
Red Grange got a hell of a write-up in the papers.
now Mozart is beginning.
I am smoking a small cigarette imported from India.
4 of my 6 cats are asleep in the next room.
my wife is downstairs.
outside it is a cold, still winter night.
I blow smoke into the desk lamp and watch it curl.
Mozart is doing very well.
Shostakovich is getting ready.
it is a late Tuesday evening.
and Red Grange is dead.
