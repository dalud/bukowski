I believe the thought came to me

when I was about eleven years
old:
I'll become an idiot.

I had noticed some in the neighborhood,

those who the people called
"idiots."

although looked down upon,

the idiots seemed to have the
more peaceful lives:
nothing was expected of
them.

I imagined myself standing upon

streetcorners, hands in pockets,
and drooling a bit at the
mouth.

nobody would bother

me.

I began to put my plan into

effect.

I was first noticed in the

school yards.
my mates jibed at me,
taunted me.

even my father noticed:

"you act like a god damned

idiot!"
one of my teachers noticed,

Mrs. Gredis of the long silken

legs.

she kept me after

class.

"what is it, Henry?

you can tell me…"

she put her arms

about me
and I rested myself
against
her.

"tell me, Henry, don't

be afraid…"

I didn't say

anything.

"you can stay here

as long as you
want, Henry.
you don't have to
talk…"

she kissed me on the

forehead
and I reached down
and lightly touched
one of her silken
legs.


Mrs. Gredis was a

hot number.

she kept me after

school almost every
day.
and everybody hated
me
but I believe that I

had the most wonderful

hard-ons
of any eleven year old

boy
in the city of
Los Angeles
