when my father ate

his lips became
greasy
with food.

and when he ate

he talked about how
good
the food was
and that
most other people
didn't eat
as good
as we
did.

he liked to

sop up
what was left
on his plate
with a piece of
bread,
meanwhile making
appreciative sounds
rather like
half-grunts.

he slurped his

coffee
making loud
bubbling
sounds.

then he'd put

the cup
down:
"dessert? is it
jello?"

my mother would

bring it
in a large bowl

and my father would

spoon it
out.

as it plopped

in the dish
the jello made
strange sounds,
almost fart-like
sounds.

then came the

whipped cream,
mounds of it
on the
jello.

"ah! jello and

whipped cream!"

my father sucked the

jello and whipped
cream
off his spoonâ€”
it sounded as if it
was entering a
wind
tunnel.

finished with

that
he would wipe his
mouth
with a huge white
napkin,
rubbing hard
in circular
motions,
the napkin almost
hiding his
entire
face.

after that

out came the
Camel
cigarettes.
he'd light one
with a wooden
kitchen match,
then place the
match,
still burning,
onto an
ashtray.

then a slurp of

coffee, the cup
back down, and a good

drag on the
Camel.

"ah that was a

good
meal!"


moments later

in my bedroom

on my bed
in the dark
the food that I
had eaten
and what I had

seen
was already
making me
ill.

the only good

thing
was
listening to
the crickets
out there,
out there

in another world

didn't live in.
