at this time

I know a couple of men
who seem to be in
love
while their ladies are treating
them
off-handedly or
worse.

these men are consumed by

their
ill-fate, can't
climb out of their
fix.

I too

have been in that
way,
only I was
worse
off:
I was charmed and
ensnared by
caseic beldames,
slimey slatterns,
inchoate prostitutes,
hypacodont
mesdamesâ€”
all the hustling
shrews of the
universe
found me,

and I

found them
wise
witty and
beautiful
then.

it was only after

some luck of
distance and time
that I was able to
realize
that
these ladies

were even less than

less.

so

now
when these men
tell me their sad
stories
there is nothing I can

say
because to me
their women look
like
hypacodont
beldames,
inchoate
slatterns,
caseic
mesdames
and
slimey
prostitutes,
not to mention
piss-biting

shrews

and they

most
probably
are.

true is true

enough,
yet
at small
tiny and
rare
moments

wonder what

seemed like

to my ladies?
