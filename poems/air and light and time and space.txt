"—you know, I've either had a family, a job, something

has always been in the
way
but now
I've sold my house, I've found this
place, a large studio, you should see the space and the light.

for the first time in my life I'm going to have a place and the time to create."

no baby, if you're going to create you're going to create whether you work 16 hours a day in a coal mine or

you're going to create in a small room with 3 children
while you're on
welfare,
you're going to create with part of your mind and your
body blown
away,
you're going to create blind
crippled
demented,

you're going to create with a cat crawling up your back while

the whole city trembles in earthquake, bombardment, flood and fire.

baby, air and light and time and space

have nothing to do with it
and don't create anything
except maybe a longer life to find

new excuses

for.
