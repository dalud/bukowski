as the years went on I seemed to have more luck but now these jackals

these attackers from the past reappear as if nothing had ever

occurred (one doesn't mind literary criticism so long as the envy and the rancor do not show through)
and now I meet the jackals in eating
places etc.
some even come to the door

bringing entire families—mothers, fathers, old aunts…

the jackals turn on the charm

and I don't mind, let the past be
done, I pour the drinks and
listen.

it is afterwards that it occurs, usually

within a week:
a large manuscript arrives with
note: "could you read this?
publisher would like a foreword from
you…"

I brace myself, flop on the bed, give it

a read: the writing is proficient
but somewhere there is a terrible
lacking, an unnatural void…
the manuscript makes me a bit ill;
I let it fall to the
floor.


the other night I made a brief

appearance at a theater where my

video was showing and
as I was leaving
here came the poet, glass of
cheap free wine in his hand, he
poked his face into mine

and repeated his same speech all

over again as if he had forgotten
he had given it
to me before.

"remember me? we met at L's.

there's this new mag starting, it's
going to be better than Rolling
Stone…
what they want me to do is
interview you and you interview me,

we get a thousand a-piece, maybe

more…"

(said jackal had attacked me in an

article after begging me to go
to the boxing matches with him.
his face was continually
in mine, talking, talking,
"listen," I told him, "let's just
watch the fights…"
he had told
me he was there to cover the
fights, but he wasn't: the
article was about me: a
terrible human being who was a
drunk and far past his prime.)

now he kept shoving his face into

mine there on the sidewalk,

repeating his spiel: "I interview

you, you interview me…one
thousand, what do you think, huh,

huh?"
"I'll let you know," I told
him.

but he just kept walking along,

pushing his face into mine…

well, I thought, I am going to

have to punch him out.

but I tried something else

first:

"get the fuck away from me!"

he backed off and I walked off

to a better place…

give it a week, I came in from the

track one evening and here was a

large package: 3 of his latest
books from a local press.
I flipped through the pages:
a breezy, bantering style
playing the open, good
human guy but it was like he
was writing on benzedrine
lashing you with shreds of his
soul,
but it was more boring-than
derring-do.

there was a note with phone

number, home address:

"I'll interview you, you

interview me, the editor thinks
it's a great idea…and there's a
grand a-piece in it for each of
us, maybe more…"
I walked into the kitchen and
dumped him into the trash
bag.

I fed the cats and then the phone

rang.
it was a new voice:

"Chinaski?"

"yes?"

"listen, you don't know me

but my name is Dipper
and I got a great deal for
you."

"listen, how did you get my

phone number?"

"hey, man, what difference

does that make?"

I hung up.

in a moment the phone was ringing

again.

I walked into the front room

looked out the south window, it
looked fine out there: trees, lawn,

shrubbery,

not a jackal in

sight.
