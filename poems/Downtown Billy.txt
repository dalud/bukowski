they used to call him

"Downtown" Billy.

"Downtown" had these

long arms
and he swung them
with
abandon
and with great
force.

when you fought

"Downtown" Billy
you never knew
where the punches
were coming
from: "They come
from Downtownâ€¦"

"Downtown" once rose

all the way
to #4 in his weight
class,
then he dropped out
of the first
ten.

then he fell to

fighting 6 rounders,
then 4.


the punches still

came from

Downtown
but you could
see them
coming.
then he was just a
sparring
partner.

last I heard

he left
town.

today I feel

like "Downtown" Billy,

sitting in this
blue garden chair
under the
walnut
tree,
watching the
neighbor boy
bounce a
basketball,
take some
fancy steps
forward,
then loop the
ball
through the
hoop
over the
garage
door.

I have just taken

my
pills.
