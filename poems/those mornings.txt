I still remember those New Orleans rats

out on the balcony railings
in the dark of early morning
as I stood waiting my turn at the
crapper.
there were always two or three
big ones
just sitting thereâ€”sometimes they'd
move quickly then
stop and sit there.
I looked at them and they looked at
me.
they showed no fear.

at last the crapper door would open

and out would walk
one of the tenants
and he always looked worse than
the rats
and then he'd be gone
down the hallway
and I'd go into the still-stinking
crapper
with my hangover.

and almost always

when I came out
the rats would be gone.
as soon as it got a little light
they would
vanish.

and then

the world would be
mine,

I'd walk down the stairway

and into it
and my low-wage
pitiful
job
while remembering the
rats,

how it was better for them

than for
me.

I walked to work as the sun

came up hot
and the whores slept
like
babies.
