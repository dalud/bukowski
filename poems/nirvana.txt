not much chance,

completely cut loose from
purpose,
he was a young man
riding a bus
through North Carolina
on the way to
somewhere
and it began to snow
and the bus stopped
at a little cafe
in the hills
and the passengers
entered.

he sat at the counter

with the others,
he ordered and the
food arrived.
the meal was
particularly
good
and the
coffee.

the waitress was

unlike the women
he had
known.
she was unaffected,
there was a natural
humor which came

from her.

the fry cook said
crazy things.
the dishwasher,
in back,
laughed, a good
clean
pleasant
laugh.

the young man watched

the snow through the
windows.

he wanted to stay

in that cafe
forever.

the curious feeling

swam through him
that everything
was
beautiful
there,
that it would always
stay beautiful
there.

then the bus driver

told the passengers
that it was time
to board.

the young man

thought, I'll just sit
here, I'll just stay
here.

but then

he rose and followed

the others into the
bus.

he found his seat

and looked at the cafe

through the bus
window.

then the bus moved

off, down a curve,
downward, out of
the hills.

the young man

looked straight
forward.
he heard the other
passengers
speaking
of other things,
or they were
reading
or
attempting to
sleep.

they had not

noticed
the
magic.

the young man

put his head to
one side,
closed his
eyes,
pretended to

sleep.

there was nothing

else to doâ€”
just listen to the
sound of the
engine,
the sound of the

tires
in the
snow.
