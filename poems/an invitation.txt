hey Chinaski:

I am a filmmaker in the Hollywood area and I am currently making a movie in which I would like to include you.

The nature of the movie is about an alcoholic Satan who decides to leave hell for a while and have a vacation in Hollywood.

This particular version of Satan is a fun guy who can't get enough booze, SLUTS, or adventure.

Satan, while in Hollywood looks up his old buddies (Ghosts) Richard Burton, Errol Flynn and Idi Amin (still alive).

He proceeds to get smashed with these
guys and they all pass out on him so
he needs to look up a mortal worthy of
drinking with him (YOU).
The scene I have envisioned with you would be to be sitting around a crummy joint, drinking Mezcal and playing Russian Roulette with Satan while 2 big fat chicks are slapping each other with Salamis.

I would want everybody in the scene to be SMASHED.

I can tell you now that I couldn't pay you anything up front xcept Booze and adventure.
—However—
I am going to hopefully be able to release this movie one day and would be happy to work out a contractual agreement that would arrange a royalty rate—(if you are

interested.)

And thanks for mentioning in your

writing, KNUT HAMSUN.
he has turned out to be one of my

faves.
And just remember,
WHEN IN DOUBT,
PASS OUT!
