the people survive to come up with flat fists full of nothing.

I remember Carl Sandburg's poem, "The People, Yes."

nice thought but completely inaccurate: the people did not survive through a noble strength but through lie, compromise and guile.

I lived with these people, I am not so sure what people Sandburg lived with.
but his poem always pissed me off.
it was a poem that lied.
it is "The People, No."
then and now.
and it doesn't take a misanthrope to
say this.

let us hope that future famous poems

such as Mr. Sandburg's
make more
sense.
