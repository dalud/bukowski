the boy was going to take the bus out

to see the
Graceland Mansion

then

the Greyhound Lines went
on strike.

there were only two clerks

and two lines
at the station
and the lines were
50 to 65 people
long.

after two hours in line

one of the clerks told the
boy
that his bus
would leave
as soon as the substitute
driver arrived.

"when will that be?" the

boy asked.

"we can't

be certain," the
clerk answered.


the boy slept on the floor

that night

but by 9 a.m.
the next morning
the substitute driver
still had not
arrived.
the boy had to wait
in another line
to get to the
toilet.

he finally got a

stall, carefully
fitted the
sanitary toilet seat
paper cover,
pulled down his
pants,
his shorts
and
sat down.

luckily

the boy had a
pencil.

he found a clean

space
among all the

smeared and demented

scrawlings and
drawings

and very

carefully
and
heavily
he printed:


HEARTBREAK HOTEL

then he dropped the

first
one.
