hell is built

piece by piece
brick by brick
around
you.
it's a gradual,
not a rapid
process.

we build our

own
inferno,
blame
others.

but hell is

hell.

wordly hell is

hell.

my hell and

your
hell.

our

hell.

hell, hell,

hell.

the song of

hell.

putting your

shoes on
in the
morning.
hell.
