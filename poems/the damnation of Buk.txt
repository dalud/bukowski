getting old, and older, concerned that

you might not get your driver's license
renewed, concerned that the hangovers
last longer, concerned that you might
not reach the age of 85,
concerned that the poems will stop
arriving.
concerned that you are concerned.

concerned that you might die in the

spa.
concerned that you might die on the
freeway while driving in from the
track.
concerned that you might die in your
lap pool.
concerned that the remainder of your
teeth
will not last.

concerned about dying but not about

death.

concerned that people will no longer

consider you dangerous when
drunk.

concerned that you will forget who

the enemy is.

concerned that you will forget how to

laugh.


concerned that there will be nothing to

drink in hell.
and concerned you will have to
listen to
one poetry reading
after another
after anotherâ€¦

the Los Angeles poets

the New York poets
the Iowa poets

the black poets

the white poets
the Chicano poets
the 3rd world poets

the female poets

the homosexual poets
the lesbian poets
the bisexual poets
the sexless poets
the failed poets
the famous poets
the dead poets
the etc. poets

concerned that the toteboard will

explode into flowers of
shit

and the night will never

come.
