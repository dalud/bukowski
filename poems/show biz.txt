I can't have it

and you can't have it
and we won't
get it

so don't bet on it

or even think about
it

just get out of bed

each morning

wash

shave
clothe
yourself
and go out into
it

because

outside of that
all that's left is
suicide and
madness

so you just

can't
expect too much

you can't even

expect


so what you do

is
work from a modest

minimal
base
like when you
walk outside
be glad your car
might possibly
be there

and if it is—

that the tires
aren't
flat

then you get

in
and if it
starts—you
start.

and

it's the damndest
movie
you've ever
seen
because
you're
in it—

low budget

and
billion critics

and the longest

run

you ever hope

for
is

one

day.
