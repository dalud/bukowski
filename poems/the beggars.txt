the poor

in the grandstand section
playing the
daily doubles
the exactas
the pick-6's
the pick-9's

they have horrible

jobs
or
no jobs

they come in

beaten
to take another
beating.

scuffed shoes

shirts with buttons
missing,
faded and wrinkled
clothingâ€”
muted eyes,
they are the
unwashed
the
unwanted

the beggars of the

grandstand

and as race after race

unfolds
they are routinely
sucked of
money and
hope
then
the last race is
over

and for a few

there's the
liquor
store

a bit to drink

and a
lottery
ticket.

for the

others:
nothing.

beggars of the

grandstand.

the State is going

to
make it.

the track is going

to
make
it


thanks to the

Days of the Living

Dead.

well,

the horses are
beautiful
anyhow.
