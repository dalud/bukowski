even when starving

the rejection slips hardly ever bothered me: I only believed that the editors were truly stupid
and I just went on and wrote more and
more.
I even considered rejects as
action; the worst was the empty
mailbox.

if I had a weakness or a dream

it was
that I only wanted to see one of these
editors
who rejected me,
to see his or her face, the way they
dressed, the way they walked across a
room, the sound of their voice, the look
in their eye…
just one look at one of
them—

you see, when all you look at is

a piece of printed paper
telling you that you
aren't very good,
then there is a tendency
to think that the editors
are more god-like than
they are.


hell is a closed door

when you're starving for your goddamned art

but sometimes you feel at least like having a

peek through the
keyhole.
young or old, good or bad,
I don't think anything dies as slow and
as hard as a
writer.
