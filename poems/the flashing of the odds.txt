parking lot attendant, Bobby, was funny,

wise-cracking, laughing, was
good at it, he was an original,
sometimes when I was down
listening to Bobby brought me back
up.

didn't see him for 3 weeks, asked the

other attendants but they didn't know
or made things up.

drove in today and there was

Bobby, his uniform wrinkled, he was just standing there while the others worked.

approached him and he seemed to

recognize me, then spoke: "got all
stressed out driving here, it took me
3 hours!"

he wasn't laughing, had grown suddenly

fat, his belt buckle was
unfastened, I buckled him up, he
had a 3 day beard,
his
hair was grey, his face wrinkled, his
eyes stuck in a backwash, 20 years
lost in 3 weeks.

"good to see you, Bobby."

"yeah, sure, when you going to buy

this place?"

he was talking about the

racetrack.
I walked across the lot and into
the track, took the escalator

up, reached the top floor, walked

toward the service stand.
Betty saw me and got my coffee

poured.

"you ready for a big day?"

she asked.

"I'm ready for any kind of

day."

"you come here to win, don't

you?"

"I come here not to

lose."

I took my coffee to a seat

facing the toteboard.
the odds flashed, I sat down
spilling hot coffee
on my
hand.

"shit," I said.

and the day went

on.
