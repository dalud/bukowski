it was one of those hot and tiring days at Hollywood Park
with a huge crowd, a
tiring, rude, dumb
crowd.

I won the last race and stayed to collect and when I got to my car

there was a massive jam of traffic attempting to work its way out of there.

so I took my shoes off, sat and waited, turned on the radio, lucked onto some classical music, found

a pint of Scotch in the glove compartment, uncapped

it, had a
hit.

I'm going to let them all get out of here, I

thought, then I'll
go.

I found ¾'s of a cigar, lit it, had another hit of Scotch.

I listened to the music, smoked, drank the Scotch and watched the losers leave.

there was even a little crap game going

about 100 yards to the
east


then that

broke up.

I decided to finish the

pint.
I did, then stretched out on the
seat.

I don't know how long I

slept
but when I awakened it was dark and
the parking lot was
empty.

I decided not to put on my shoes, started the car and drove out of
there….

when I got back to my place I could hear the phone ringing.

as I put the key in the door and opened it,

the phone kept
ringing.

I walked over, picked up the

phone.

"hello?"

"you son of a bitch, where have you

been?"

"the racetrack."

"the racetrack? it's 12:30 a.m.! I've been

phoning since

7 p.m.!"

"I just got in from the

racetrack."
"you got some woman
there?"

"no."

"I don't believe you!"

she hung up.

I walked to the refrigerator, got a beer, went to the bathroom, let the water run in the tub.
I finished the beer, got another, opened it and

climbed into the
tub.

the phone rang

again.

I got out of the tub with my beer and

dripping away
I walked to the phone, picked it
up.

"hello?"

"you son of a bitch, I still don't

believe you!"

she hung up.

I walked back to the tub with my beer,

leaving another trail of

water.

as I got back into the tub

the phone rang
again.

I let it ring, counting the

rings: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,
10,11,12,13,14,15,
16…

she hung up.

then, perhaps, 3 or 4 minutes

passed.

the phone rang

again.

I counted the rings:

1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,
9…

then it was

quiet.

about then I remembered I had

left my shoes in the
car.
no matter, except I only had
one pair.

chances were, though, that nobody

would ever want to steal that
car.


I got out of the tub for another

beer,

leaving another trail

behind me.

it was the end of a

long
long
day.
