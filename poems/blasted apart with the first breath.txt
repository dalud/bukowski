running out of days

as the banister glints
in the early morning sun.

there will be no rest

even in our dreams.

now, all there is to do is

reset
broken moments.

when even to exist seems a

victory
then surely our luck has
run thin

thinner than a bloody stream

toward death.

life is a sad song:

we have heard too many
voices
seen too many
faces
too many
bodies

worst have been the faces:

a dirty joke that no one
can understand.

barbaric, senseless days total

in your skull;
reality is a juiceless
orange.
there is no plan
no out
no divinity
no sparrow of
joy.

we can't compare life to

anythingâ€”that's
too dreary a
prospect.

relatively speaking,

we were never short on
courage

but, at best, the odds

remained long
and
at worst,
unchangeable.

and what was worst:

not that we wasted
it
but that it was
wasted
on us:

coming out of

the Womb
trapped
in light and
darkness

stricken and numbed

alone in the temperate zone of

dumb agony
now

running out of days

as the banister glints
in the early morning sun.
