what will they be writing about 2,000 years from now
if they are
here?

now

I drink cabernet sauvignon while
listening to
Bach: it's

most curious: this

continuing death

this
continuing life

as

I look at this hand
holding a cigarette
I feel as if
I have been here
forever.

now

troops with bayonets
sack
the town below.
my dog, Tony, smiles at
me.

it is well

to feel good
for no reason;
or

with a limited

choice to
choose
anyhow;
or with a little love,
not to buckle to
hatred.

faith, brother, not in the

gods
but in
yourself:
don't ask,
tell.

I tell you

such fine
music
waits
in the
shadows
of
hell.
