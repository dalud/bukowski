it was a New Year's Eve party at my place

think.
was standing holding a drink when this slender young fellow walked up he was a bit drunk he said

"Hank, I met a woman who said

she was married to you for 2
years."

"really?

what was her
name?"

"Lola

Edwards."

"never heard of

her."

"ah, come on, man, she

said…"

"don't know her,

baby…"

in fact I didn't know who

he was…

I drained my drink walked to the kitchen poured a refill


I looked around yes, I was at my place

I recognized the
kitchen.
another
Happy New Year.

Jesus.

I walked out to face the

people.
