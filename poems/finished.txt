the ball comes up to the

plate and I can't
see
it.

my batting average has dropped to

.231

small things constantly

irritate me
and I can't sleep
nights.

"you'll come back,

Harry," my teammates
tell me.

then they grin and are

secretly
pleased.

I've been benched for a

22 year old
kid.

he looks good up there:

power, lots of line
drives.

"ever thought of coaching?"

the manager asks.


"no," I tell him, "how about

you?"

when I get home my wife

asks, "you get in the lineup

tonight?"
"nope."

"don't worry, he'll put you

in."

"no, he won't. I'm gonna

pinch hit the rest of the
season."

I go into the bathroom and

look into the
mirror.

I'm no 22 year old

kid.

what gets me is that it

seemed to happen
overnight.

one night I was good.

the next night, it
seemed, I was
finished.

I come out of the bathroom

and my wife says,
"don't worry, all you need

is a little
rest."


"I been thinking about going

into coaching," I tell
her.

"sure," she says, "and after

that I'll bet you'll be a
good manager."

"hell yes," I say, "anything

on tv?"
