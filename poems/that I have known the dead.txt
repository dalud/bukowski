that I have known the dead and now I'm

dying
as they spoon succotash and
noodles
into a skull
past
caring.

that I have known the dead and now I'm

dying
in a world long ago
gone

leaving this is

nothing.
loving it was
too.

that I have known the dead and now I'm

dying
fingers thin to the
bone,
I offer no
prayers.

that I have known the dead and now I'm

dying

dying

I have known the dead

here on earth

and elsewhere;

alone now,
alone then,
alone.
