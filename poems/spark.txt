I always resented all the years, the hours, the minutes I gave them as a working stiff, it actually hurt my head, my insides, it made me dizzy and a bit crazyâ€”I couldn't understand the murdering of my years

yet my fellow workers gave no signs of
agony, many of them even seemed satisfied, and seeing them that way drove me almost as crazy as the dull and senseless work.

the workers submitted.

the work pounded them to nothingness, they were scooped-out and thrown away.

I resented each minute, every minute as it was mutilated
and nothing relieved the monotony.

I considered suicide.

I drank away my few leisure hours.

I worked for decades.

I lived with the worst kind of women, they killed what the job failed to kill.

I knew that I was dying.

something in me said, go ahead, die, sleep, become as them, accept.


then something else in me said, no, save the tiniest

bit.

it needn't be much, just a spark.

a spark can set a whole forest on

fire.
just a spark.
save it.
I think I did.
I'm glad I did.
what a lucky god damned
thing.
