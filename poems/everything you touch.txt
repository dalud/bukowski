putting on your torn clothes in an old New Orleans roominghouse, you and your stockboy soul,

then rolling your little green wagon past the salesgirls who took no notice of you, those girls dreaming of bigger game with their tiny rectangular brains.

or in Los Angeles, coming in from your shipping clerk job at an auto parts warehouse, taking the elevator up to 319 to find your woman sprawled out on the bed, drunk at 6 p.m.

you were never any good at picking them, you always got the leftovers, the crazies, the alkies, the pill-freaks.

maybe that was all you could get and maybe you were all they could get.

you went to the bars and found more alkies, pill-freaks, crazies. all they had to show you were a pair of well-turned ankles in spike-heeled shoes.
you thumped up and down on beds with them as if you had discovered

the meaning of
existence.

then there was this day at work when Larry the salesman came down the

aisle with his big belly and his little button eyes, Larry always walked loudly on leather-soled shoes and he was almost always whistling.

he stopped whistling and stood at your shipping table as you worked.


then he began rocking back and forth, he had this habit and

he stood there rocking, observing you, he was one of those jokers, you know, and then he began laughing, you were sick from a long crazy night, needed a shave, you were dressed in a torn shirt.

"what is it, Larry?" you asked.

and then he said, "Hank, everything you touch turns to shit!"


you couldn't argue with him about that.
