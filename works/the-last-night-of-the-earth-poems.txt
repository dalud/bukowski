jam










that Harbor Freeway south through the downtown area—I mean, it can simply become unbelievable.


last Friday evening I was sitting there motionless behind a wall of red taillights, there wasn’t even first gear movement as masses of exhaust fumes
greyed the evening air, engines overheated
and there was the smell of a clutch
burning out
somewhere—


it seemed to come from ahead of me— from that long slow rise of freeway where the cars were working from first gear to neutral
again and again
and from neutral back to
first gear.


on the radio I heard the news


of that day
at least 6 times, I was
well versed in world
affairs.
the remainder of the stations played a
thin, sick music.
the classical stations refused to come in
clearly
and when they did
it was a stale repetition of standard and
tiresome works.


I turned the radio off.


a strange whirling began in my
head—it circled behind the forehead, clockwise, went past the ears and around to the
back of the head, then back to the forehead
and around
again.
I began to wonder, is this what happens
when one goes
mad?


I considered getting out of my car.


I was in the so-called fast
lane.
I could see myself out there
out of my car
leaning against the freeway divider,
arms folded.
then I would slide down to a sitting
position, putting my head between
my legs.


I stayed in the car, bit my tongue, turned


the radio back on, willed the whirling to
stop
as I wondered if any of the others had to
battled against their
compulsions
as I did?


then the car ahead of me


MOVED
a foot, 2 feet, 3 feet!


I shifted to first gear…


there was MOVEMENT!
then I was back in neutral
BUT


we had moved from 7 to
ten feet.


hearing the world news for the


7th time,
it was still all bad
but all of us listening,
we could handle that too
because we knew


that there was nothing worse than


looking at
that same license plate


that same dumb head sticking up


from behind the headrest
in the car ahead of you
as time dissolved


as the temperature gauge leaned


more to the right
as the gas gauge leaned
more to the left
as we wondered
whose clutch was burning
out?


we were like some last, vast


final dinosaur
crawling feebly home somewhere,


somehow, maybe
to
die.


two toughs










at L.A. City College there were two toughs, me and Jed Anderson. Anderson was one of the best running backs in the


history of the school, a real breakaway threat anytime he got the football.


I was pretty tough physically but looked at sports as a game for freaks.
I thought a bigger game was challenging those
who attempted to teach
us.


anyhow, Jed and I were the two biggest lights on


campus, he piled up his 60, 70 and 80 yard
runs in the night games
and during the days
slouched in my seat
I made up what I didn’t know
and what I did know
was so bad
many a teacher was made to
dance to it.


and one grand day


Jed and I
finally met.
it was at a little jukebox place
across from campus and
he was sitting with his
pals
and I was sitting with
mine.


“go on! go on! talk to him!”
my pals


urged.
I said, “fuck that gym
boy. I am one with
Nietzsche, let him come
over here!”


finally Jed got up to get a


pack of smokes from the
machine and one of my
friends asked,
“are you afraid of that
man?”


I got up and walked behind


Jed as he was reaching into the


machine
for his pack.


“hello, Jed,” I


said.


he turned: “hello,


Hank.”


then he reached into his


rear pocket,
pulled out a pint of
whiskey, handed it to
me.


I took a mighty hit,


handed it
back.


“Jed, what are you


going to do
after


L.A.C.C.?”


“I’m going to play


for Notre Dame.”
then he walked back
to his table
and I walked back
to mine.


“what’d he say? what’d


he say?”


“nothing much.”


anyhow, Jed never made it


to Notre Dame
and I never made it
anywhere
either—
the years just swept us
away
but there were others
who went
on, including one fellow
who became a famous
sports columnist
and I had to look at his
photo
for decades
in the newspaper
as I inherited those
cheap rooms
and those roaches
and those airless
dreary
nights.
but


I was still proud of that moment


back then
when Jed handed me
that pint
and
I drained
a third of it
with all the disciples
watching.
damn, there was no way
it seemed
we could ever
lose
but we did.


and it took me


3 or 4 decades to
move on just a
little.
and Jed,
if you are still here
tonight,
(I forgot to tell you
then)
here’s a thanks
for that drink.


my German buddy










tonight


drinking Singha
malt liquor from
Thailand
and listening to
Wagner


I can’t believe that


he is not in
the other
room
or around the
corner
or alive
someplace
tonight


and he is


of course
as I am taken
by the sound of
him


and little goosebumps


run along
both of my
arms


then a


chill


he’s here


now.


happy birthday










when Wagner was an


old man
a birthday party was given
in his
honor
and a couple of
youthful
incidental compositions
were played.


afterwards


he asked,
“who wrote those?”


“you did,” he was


told.


“ah,” he responded,


“it’s as I have always
suspected: death
then
does have some
virtue.”


the telephone












will bring you people


with its ring,
people who do not know what to do with their time
and they will ache to
infect you with
this
from a distance
(although they would prefer
to actually be in the same room
to better project their nullity upon
you).


the telephone is needed for


emergency purposes only.


these people are not


emergencies, they are
calamities.


I have never welcomed the ring of a


telephone.


“hello,” I will answer


guardedly.


“this is Dwight.”


already you can feel their imbecile


yearning to invade.
they are the people-fleas that
crawl the


psyche.


“yes, what is it?”


“well, I’m in town tonight and
I thought…”


“listen, Dwight, I’m tied up, I


can’t…”


“well, maybe another


time?”


“maybe not…”


each person is only given so many


evenings
and each wasted evening is
a gross violation against the
natural course of
your only
life;
besides, it leaves an aftertaste
which often lasts two or three days


depending upon the
visitor.


the telephone is only for


emergency purposes.


it has taken me


decades
but I have finally found out
how to say
“no.”


now
don’t be concerned for them,


please:
they will simply dial another


number.


it could be


yours.
“hello,” you will
say.


and they will say,


“this is Dwight.”


and then


you
be
the kind
understanding
soul.


begging










like most of you, I’ve had so many jobs that I feel as if I were gutted and my insides thrown to the winds.
I’ve met some good people along the
way and also the
other kind.
yet when I think of all those
I have worked with—
even though decades have passed—
Karl
comes to mind
first.


I remember Karl: our jobs required we


both wear aprons
tied from behind and around
the neck with string.


I was Karl’s underling.


“we got an easy job,” he
told me.


each day as one by one our superiors arrived Karl would make a slight bend at the waist, smile, and with a nod of the head greet each: “good morning Dr. Stein,”
or, “good morning Mr. Day” or


Mrs. Knight or if the lady was unattached “good morning, Lilly” or Betty or Fran.


* never spoke.


Karl seemed concerned at this and


one day he took me aside: “hey,
where the fuck else you going to get a
two hour lunch like we
do?”


“nowhere, I guess…”


“well, o.k., look, for guys like you and me, this is as good as it can get, this is all there is.”


I waited.


“so look, it’s hard to suck up to them at first, it didn’t come easy for me
but after a while I realized that it
didn’t matter.
I just grew a shell.
now I’ve got my shell, got
it?”


I looked at him and sure enough he did look like he had a shell, there was a mask-like look to his


face and the eyes were null, void and undisturbed; I was looking at a weathered and beaten conch.


some weeks went by.


nothing changed: Karl bowed and scraped and smiled


undaunted, perfect in his
role.
that we were perishable, perhaps didn’t occur to
him
or
that greater gods might be
watching.


I did my


work.
then, one day, Karl took me
aside again.


“listen, Dr. Morely spoke to me


about you.”


“yes?”


“he asked me what was wrong with


you.”


“what did you tell


him?”


“I told him that you were


young.”


“thanks.”


upon receiving my next check, I


quit


but


still


had to
eventually settle for another similar


job
and
viewing the
new Karls
I finally forgave them all
but not myself:


being perishable sometimes makes a


man
strange
almost
unemployable
most
obnoxious—
no servant of
free
enterprise.


the feel of it












A. Huxley died at 69,


much too early for such a
fierce talent,
and I read all his
works
but actually
Point Counter Point
did help a bit
in carrying me through
the factories and the
drunk tanks and the
unsavory
ladies.
that
book
along with Hamsun’s
Hunger
they helped a
bit.
great books are
the ones we
need.


I was astonished at


myself for liking the
Huxley book
but it did come from
such a rabid
beautiful
pessimistic
intellectualism,
and when I first
read P.C.P.


I was living in a
hotel room
with a wild and
crazy
alcoholic woman
who once threw
Pound’s Cantos
at me
and missed,
as they did
with me.


I was working


as a packer
in a light fixture
plant
and once
during a drinking
bout
I told the lady,
“here, read this!”
(referring to
Point Counter
Point.)


“ah, jam it up


your ass!” she
screamed at
me.


anyhow, 69 seemed


too early for Aldous


Huxley to
die.
but I guess it’s
just as fair
as the death of a
scrubwoman


at the same
age.


it’s just that


with those who
help us
get on through,
then
all that light
dying, it works the
gut a bit—
scrubwomen, cab drivers,


cops, nurses, bank
robbers, priests,
fishermen, fry cooks,
jockeys and the
like
be
damned.


the greatest actor of our day












he’s getting fatter and fatter,


almost bald
he has a wisp of hair
in the back
which he twists
and holds
with a rubber band.


he’s got a place in the hills


and he’s got a place in the
islands
and few people ever see
him.
some consider him the greatest
actor of our
day.


he has few friends, a


very few.
with them, his favorite
pastime is
eating.


at rare times he is reached


by telephone
usually
with an offer to act
in an exceptional (he’s
told)
motion picture.


he answers in a very soft
voice:


“oh, no, I don’t want to


make any more movies…”


“can we send you the
screenplay?”


“all right…”


then


he’s not heard from
again.


usually


what he and his few friends


do
after eating
(if the night is cold)
is to have a few drinks
and watch the screenplays


burn
in the fireplace.


or


after eating (on
warm evenings)
after a few
drinks
the screenplays
are taken
frozen
out of cold
storage.
he hands some
to his friends
keeps some
then
together
from the veranda


they toss them
like flying saucers
far out
into the spacious
canyon
below.


then


they all go
back in
knowing
instinctively
that the screenplays
were
bad. (at least,
he senses it and
they
accept
that.)


it’s a real good


world
up there:


well-earned, self-sufficient


and
hardly
dependent
upon the
variables.


there’s


all that time
to eat
drink
and
wait on death
like
everybody


else.


days like razors, nights full of rats










as a very young man I divided an equal amount of time between the bars and the libraries; how I managed to provide for


my other ordinary needs is the puzzle; well, I simply didn’t bother too much with that—


if I had a book or a drink then I didn’t think too much of other things—fools create their own paradise.


in the bars, I thought I was a tough, I broke things, fought other men, etc.


in the libraries it was another matter: I was quiet, went from room to room, didn’t so much read entire books as parts of them: medicine, geology, literature and philosophy. psychology, math, history, other things, put me off. with music I was more interested in the music and in the lives of the composers than in the technical aspects…


however, it was with the philosophers that I felt a brotherhood:


Schopenhauer and Nietzsche, even old hard-to-read Kant; I found Santayana, who was very popular at the time, to be limp and a bore; Hegel you really had to dig for, especially with a hangover; there are many I read who I have forgotten, perhaps properly so, but I remember one fellow who wrote an entire book in which he proved that the moon was not there and he did it so well that afterwards you thought, he’s absolutely right, the moon is not there.
how the hell is a young man going to deign to work an 8 hour day when the moon isn’t even there? what else
might be missing?
and


I didn’t like literature so much as I did the literary critics; they were real pricks, those guys; they used fine language, beautiful in its way, to call other critics, other writers, assholes. they perked me up.


but it was the philosophers who satisfied that need


that lurked somewhere within my confused skull: wading through their excesses and their clotted vocabulary
they still often
stunned
leaped out


with a flaming gambling statement that appeared to be absolute truth or damned near absolute truth,


and this certainty was what I was searching for in a daily life that seemed more like a piece of cardboard.


what great fellows those old dogs were, they got me past days like razors and nights full of rats; and women bargaining like auctioneers from hell.


my brothers, the philosophers, they spoke to me unlike anybody on the streets or anywhere else; they filled an immense void.
such good boys, ah, such good
boys!


yes, the libraries helped; in my other temple, the bars, it was another matter, more simplistic, the language and the way was different…


library days, bar nights.
the nights were alike,


there’s some fellow sitting nearby, maybe not a bad sort, but for me he doesn’t shine right,
there’s a gruesome deadness there—I think of my father, of schoolteachers, of faces on coins and bills, of dreams about murderers with dull eyes; well,


somehow this fellow and I get to exchanging glances, a fury slowly begins to gather: we are enemies, cat and dog, priest and atheist, fire and water; tension builds, block piled upon block, waiting for the crash; our hands fold and unfold, we drink, now, finally with a purpose:


his face turns to me:


“sumpin’ ya don’t like, buddy?”


“yeah. you.”


“wanna do sumpin’ about it?”


“certainly.”


we finish our drinks, rise, move to the back of the bar, out into the alley; we turn, face each other.


I say to him, “there’s nothing but space between us. you


care to close that
space?”


he rushes toward me and somehow it’s a part of the part of the part.


in and out of the dark










my wife likes movie houses, the popcorn and soft drinks, the settling into seats, she finds a child’s delight in
this and I am happy for her—but really, I myself, I must have come from another place, I must have been a mole in another life, something that burrowed and hid alone:


the other people crowded in the seats, near and far, give me feelings that I dislike; it’s stupid, maybe, but there it is; and then
there’s the darkness and then the
giant human faces, bodies, that move about on the screen, they


speak and we
listen.


of one hundred movies there’s one that’s fair, one that’s good and ninety eight that are very bad. most movies start badly and steadily get
worse;


if you can believe the actions and speech of the characters
you might even believe that the popcorn you chew also
has a meaning of
sorts.


(well, it might be that people see so many movies that when they finally see one not so bad as the others, they think it’s


great. an Academy Award means that you don’t stink quite as much as your cousin.)


the movie ends and we are out in the street, moving


toward the car; “well,” says my wife, “it wasn’t as
good as they say.”
“no,” I say, “it wasn’t.”


“there were a few good parts, though,” she replies.


“yeah,” I answer.
we are at the car, get in, then I am driving us out of that part of town; we look around at the night; the night looks good.


“you hungry?” she asks.


“yes. you?”


we stop at a signal; I watch the red light;


I could eat that red light—anything, anything at


all to fill the void; millions of dollars spent to create something more terrible than the actual lives of most living things; one should never have to pay an admission to hell.


the light changes and we escape,


forward.


be kind










we are always asked


to understand the other person’s
viewpoint
no matter how
out-dated
foolish or
obnoxious.


one is asked


to view
their total error
their life-waste
with
kindliness,
especially if they are
aged.


but age is the total of


our doing.
they have aged
badly
because they have
lived
out of focus,
they have refused to
see.


not their fault?


whose fault?


mine?
I am asked to hide


my viewpoint
from them
for fear of their
fear.


age is no crime


but the shame


of a deliberately
wasted
life


among so many


deliberately
wasted
lives


is.


the man with the beautiful eyes












when we were kids


there was a strange house
all the shades were
always
drawn
and we never heard voices
in there
and the yard was full of
bamboo
and we liked to play in
the bamboo
pretend we were
Tarzan
(although there was no
Jane).
and there was a
fish pond
a large one
full of the
fattest goldfish
you ever saw
and they were
tame.
they came to the
surface of the water
and took pieces of
bread
from our hands.


our parents had


told us:
“never go near that
house.”


so, of course,
we went.


we wondered if anybody


lived there.
weeks went by and we


never saw
anybody.


then one day


we heard
a voice
from the house
“YOU GOD DAMNED
WHORE!”


it was a man’s


voice.


then the screen


door
of the house was
flung open
and the man
walked
out.


he was holding a


fifth of whiskey
in his right
hand.
he was about
30.
he had a cigar
in his
mouth,
needed a
shave.
his hair was


wild and
uncombed
and he was
barefoot
in undershirt
and pants.
but his eyes
were
bright.
they blazed
with
brightness
and he said,
“hey, little
gentlemen,
having a good
time, I
hope?”


then he gave a


little laugh
and walked
back into the
house.


we left,


went back to my


parents’ yard
and thought
about it.


our parents,


we decided,
had wanted us
to stay away
from there
because they
never wanted us


to see a man
like
that,


a strong natural


man
with
beautiful
eyes.


our parents


were ashamed


that they were
not
like that
man,
that’s why they


wanted us
to stay
away.


but


we went back
to that house


and the bamboo


and the tame
goldfish.
we went back
many times
for many
weeks
but we never
saw
or heard
the man
again.


the shades were
down


as always
and it was
quiet.


then one day


as we came back from


school
we saw the
house.


it had burned


down,
there was nothing
left,
just a smoldering
twisted black
foundation
and we went to
the fish pond
and there was
no water
in it
and the fat
orange goldfish
were dead
there,
drying out.


we went back to


my parents’ yard
and talked about
it
and decided that
our parents had
burned their
house down,
had killed
them


had killed the
goldfish
because it was
all too
beautiful,
even the bamboo
forest had
burned.
they had been
afraid of
the man with the
beautiful
eyes.


and


we were afraid
then
that


all throughout our lives


things like that
would
happen,
that nobody
wanted
anybody
to be
strong and
beautiful
like that,
that
others would never
allow it,
and that
many people
would have to
die.


a strange day










it was one of those hot and tiring days at Hollywood Park
with a huge crowd, a
tiring, rude, dumb
crowd.


I won the last race and stayed to collect and when I got to my car


there was a massive jam of traffic attempting to work its way out of there.


so I took my shoes off, sat and waited, turned on the radio, lucked onto some classical music, found


a pint of Scotch in the glove compartment, uncapped


it, had a
hit.


I’m going to let them all get out of here, I


thought, then I’ll
go.


I found ¾’s of a cigar, lit it, had another hit of Scotch.


I listened to the music, smoked, drank the Scotch and watched the losers leave.


there was even a little crap game going


about 100 yards to the
east


then that


broke up.


I decided to finish the


pint.
I did, then stretched out on the
seat.


I don’t know how long I


slept
but when I awakened it was dark and
the parking lot was
empty.


I decided not to put on my shoes, started the car and drove out of
there….


when I got back to my place I could hear the phone ringing.


as I put the key in the door and opened it,


the phone kept
ringing.


I walked over, picked up the


phone.


“hello?”


“you son of a bitch, where have you


been?”


“the racetrack.”


“the racetrack? it’s 12:30 a.m.! I’ve been
phoning since


7 p.m.!”


“I just got in from the


racetrack.”
“you got some woman
there?”


“no.”


“I don’t believe you!”


she hung up.


I walked to the refrigerator, got a beer, went to the bathroom, let the water run in the tub.
I finished the beer, got another, opened it and


climbed into the
tub.


the phone rang


again.


I got out of the tub with my beer and


dripping away
I walked to the phone, picked it
up.


“hello?”


“you son of a bitch, I still don’t


believe you!”


she hung up.


I walked back to the tub with my beer,


leaving another trail of
water.


as I got back into the tub


the phone rang
again.


I let it ring, counting the


rings: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,
10,11,12,13,14,15,
16…


she hung up.


then, perhaps, 3 or 4 minutes


passed.


the phone rang


again.


I counted the rings:


1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,
9…


then it was


quiet.


about then I remembered I had


left my shoes in the
car.
no matter, except I only had
one pair.


chances were, though, that nobody


would ever want to steal that
car.


I got out of the tub for another
beer,


leaving another trail


behind me.


it was the end of a


long
long
day.


Trollius and trellises












of course, I may die in the next ten minutes and I’m ready for that


but what I’m really worried about is that my editor-publisher might retire even though he is ten years younger than I.


it was just 25 years ago (I was at that ripe old age of 45)
when we began our unholy alliance to
test the literary waters,
neither of us being much
known.


I think we had some luck and still have some


of same
yet
the odds are pretty fair
that he will opt for warm and pleasant
afternoons
in the garden
long before I.


writing is its own intoxication


while publishing and editing,
attempting to collect bills
carries its own
attrition
which also includes dealing with the
petty bitchings and demands
of many
so-called genius darlings who are
not.


I won’t blame him for getting


out
and hope he sends me photos of his
Rose Lane, his
Gardenia Avenue.
will I have to seek other
promulgators?
that fellow in the Russian
fur hat?
or that beast in the East
with all that hair
in his ears, with those wet and
greasy lips?


or will my editor-publisher


upon exiting for that world of Trollius and trellis
hand over the
machinery
of his former trade to a
cousin, a
daughter or
some Poundian from Big
Sur?


or will he just pass the legacy on


to the
Shipping Clerk
who will rise like
Lazarus,
fingering new-found
importance?


one can imagine terrible


things:
“Mr. Chinaski, all your work
must now be submitted in
Rondo form


and
typed
triple-spaced on rice
paper.”


power corrupts,


life aborts
and all you
have left
is a
bunch of
warts.


“no, no, Mr. Chinaski:


Rondo form!”


“hey, man,” I’ll ask,


“haven’t you heard of
the thirties?”


“the thirties? what’s


that?”


my present editor-publisher


and I
at times
did discuss the thirties,
the Depression
and
some of the little tricks it
taught us—
like how to endure on almost


nothing
and move forward
anyhow.


well, John, if it happens enjoy your
divertissement to


plant husbandry,
cultivate and aerate
between


bushes, water only in the


early morning, spread
shredding to discourage


weed growth
and
as I do in my writing:
use plenty of
manure.


and thank you


for locating me there at


5124 DeLongpre Avenue


somewhere between
alcoholism and
madness.


together we


laid down the gauntlet
and there are takers
even at this late date
still to be
found
as the fire sings
through the
trees.


air and light and time and space










“—you know, I’ve either had a family, a job, something


has always been in the
way
but now
I’ve sold my house, I’ve found this
place, a large studio, you should see the space and the light.


for the first time in my life I’m going to have a place and the time to create.”


no baby, if you’re going to create you’re going to create whether you work 16 hours a day in a coal mine or


you’re going to create in a small room with 3 children
while you’re on
welfare,
you’re going to create with part of your mind and your
body blown
away,
you’re going to create blind
crippled
demented,


you’re going to create with a cat crawling up your back while


the whole city trembles in earthquake, bombardment, flood and fire.


baby, air and light and time and space


have nothing to do with it
and don’t create anything
except maybe a longer life to find
new excuses


for.

what will they be writing about 2,000 years from now
if they are
here?


now


I drink cabernet sauvignon while
listening to
Bach: it’s


most curious: this


continuing death


this
continuing life


as


I look at this hand
holding a cigarette
I feel as if
I have been here
forever.


now


troops with bayonets
sack
the town below.
my dog, Tony, smiles at
me.


it is well


to feel good
for no reason;
or
with a limited


choice to
choose
anyhow;
or with a little love,
not to buckle to
hatred.


faith, brother, not in the


gods
but in
yourself:
don’t ask,
tell.


I tell you

waits
in the
shadows
of
hell.


bright red car










I try to avoid speed duels on the freeway but the curious thing is


that all my speeding tickets are when I am quietly driving along on


my
own.


when I am in a high speed duel, darting in and out of lanes


at near 100 m.p.h.
the police are never
about.


when I get tagged for speeding it is for cruising along, day-dreaming, at a mere 70 m.p.h.






I received 3 such nonsensical tickets in 3 weeks so I laid low for some time—2 years, in fact, but today out there
there was a fellow in a bright red car, I have no idea what model or kind
and I have no idea of how it all started but I believe that
I started it:
I was in the fast lane going about 70


and I caught the flash of bright red in my rear view and as he swung out to pass me on the right he was doing 75
and there was time for him to pass
then cut into the fast lane ahead of me


but something made me hit the throttle and cut him off


locking him in behind an old lady with a CHRIST SAVES bumper sticker.
this seemed to piss him no end


and next I knew he had swung over on my bumper, so close that his windshield and my taillights seemed one.


this pissed me no end and I was being blocked by a green Volks directly ahead


but I cut right through an opening and shot ahead.


bright red went wild, spotted the far lane open, roared over and gunned it along.






after that, it was just me and bright red


jockeying for spots.


he would garner a lead, then with a crazy gamble of lane change I would regain the lead.


during this duel my destination was forgotten and I’m sure his was too.


watching him, I couldn’t help but admire his driving skill; he took a few more chances than I but I had a little bit the better machine
so it
just about evened out.


then


suddenly
we were alone: a freak break in the traffic had set us free together and we really opened
up.


he had a short lead but my machine slowly gained; I inched up near him,
then I was at his side and I couldn’t help but
look over.


he was a young Japanese-American, maybe 18, 19


and I looked at him and
laughed.
I saw him check me out.
he saw a 70 year old white man
with a face like
Frankenstein.


the young man took his foot off the throttle and dropped back.


I let him go.


I turned the radio


on.


I was 18 miles past my destination but it


didn’t matter.


it was a beautiful sunny day.


moving toward the 21st century












it was a New Year’s Eve party at my place


* think.
* was standing holding a drink when this slender young fellow walked up he was a bit drunk he said


“Hank, I met a woman who said


she was married to you for 2
years.”


“really?


what was her
name?”


“Lola


Edwards.”


“never heard of


her.”


“ah, come on, man, she


said…”


“don’t know her,


baby…”


in fact I didn’t know who


he was…


I drained my drink walked to the kitchen poured a refill


I looked around yes, I was at my place


I recognized the
kitchen.
another
Happy New Year.


Jesus.


I walked out to face the


people.


the lady and the mountain lion












it was hardly a wilderness area


but it was countryside
and there had been a paucity of
rainfall—also some housing
construction on the
hillsides.


small game was dying


out.
the coyotes were the first of
the famished to
arrive
looking for
chickens
cats
anything.


in fact, a group attacked


a man on horseback
tearing his arm
but he
escaped.


then


in a park
there was the lady who
left her car to
go to the public
restroom.


she had closed the stall


door
when she heard a


soft
sound,
the stealth of
padded
feet.


then


as she sat there
the mountain lion stuck
his head under the
stall door.


a truly beautiful


animal.


then


the head withdrew, the cat
knocked over a trash can, circled,


emitted a slow
growl.


the lady climbed up


on the toilet
then grasped an overhead
pipe
and
swung herself completely up
(fear creates abnormal
acts) and sat where
she could watch
the cat.


at once


the cat put his
paws up
on the wash basin
stuck his head in
there


and lapped at a dripping
spigot.


then


he sank
low upon the floor
crouched
facing the doorway


then


zing
was gone
out of there.


then


at last
the lady began
screaming.


when the people


arrived
the cat was nowhere to be
seen.


the story made the


newspapers and the television


stations.


the story that won’t be told is


that the lady
will never go to the bathroom


again
without thinking of a
mountain
lion.
a truly beautiful


animal.


a laugh a minute










come on, let’s go see him, this old guy is a kick in the ass, 50 years old, he sits around in his shorts and underwear


drinking wine out of this chipped white
cup.
he sits with the shades pulled down and
he’s never owned a tv set.
the only time he goes out is for more
wine
or to the racetrack in his baby blue
’58 Comet.


you get there and he’s distraught, some woman has always left forever and
he pretends to play it with bravado but
his little slit eyes are filled with
pain.


he’ll pour drinks all around, he just gulps that crap down and then sometimes he’ll get up and puke.
it’s really something. you
can hear him for blocks.
then he’ll come out and pour another
drink.
he’ll go on and on drinking


and then once in a while he’ll say something


crazy like, “anything 3 dogs can do, 4 dogs


can do better!”
other things too.
or he’ll smash a glass or a bottle against
the wall.


he worked as an orderly in a


hospital for 15 years
then quit.
he never sleeps at night.


and for a guy that ugly


I don’t see how he gets all his
women.
and he’s jealous.
just look at one of his women
and he’ll swing on you.


then he gets drunk and tells crazy


stories and sings.
and guess what? he writes
poetry.


come on, let’s go see him, this old guy


is a kick in the
ass!


hello, Hamsun












after two-and-one-half bottles


that have not strengthened my saddened


heart


walking from this drunken


darkness
toward the bedroom
thinking of Hamsun who
ate his own flesh to
gain time to
write


I trundle into the other


room
an old
man


a hellfish in the night


swimming upward
sideways
down.


death is smoking my cigars












you know: I’m drunk once again


here
listening to Tchaikovsky
on the radio.
Jesus, I heard him 47 years
ago
when I was a starving writer
and here he is
again
and now I am a minor success as
a writer
and death is walking
up and down
this room
smoking my cigars
taking hits of my
wine
as Tchaik is working away
at the Pathétique,
it’s been some journey
and any luck I’ve had was
because I rolled the dice
right:
I starved for my art, I starved to
gain 5 god-damned minutes, 5 hours,
5 days—
I just wanted to get the word
down;
fame, money, didn’t matter:
I wanted the word down
and they wanted me at a punch press,
a factory assembly line
they wanted me to be a stock boy in a
department store.


well, death says, as he walks by,


I’m going to get you anyhow
no matter what you’ve been:


writer, cab-driver, pimp, butcher,


sky-diver, I’m going to get
you…


o.k. baby, I tell him.


we drink together now


as one a.m. slides to 2
a.m. and
only he knows the
moment, but I worked a con
on him: I got my
5 god-damned minutes
and much
more.


hock shops










were always all right with me


because when I tried to sell something in the street there were no takers.


of course, the shops offered far less than real value;


they had to profit on the
resale,
but at least, they were
there.


my favorite shop was a place in Los Angeles— this fellow would lead me to a booth where he would gather a black curtain all around us,


it slid on little rings
and then
we would be enclosed.


and it always went like


this:


“show me,” he would


say.


I would place the item on the table under


the very strong
light.


he would examine the item, then look at me for some time.
“I can’t give you very much for


this.”


another pause, then he would name his


price.
the offer was always more than I
expected.


“I’ll take $10,” I would name a


higher price.


“no,” he would answer, “in fact…”


and then he would mention a lower price


than his original
offer.


at times I would attempt to joke with


him:


“if I stay here long enough, I’ll be


paying you…”


he wouldn’t smile.


“we don’t have to do business at


all.”


“listen, I’ll accept your first offer…”


“very well,” he would say,


“but I will lose on
this…”


then he would write out the


pawn ticket and give me the
money.
“please be sure to read your ticket,


there are
stipulations.”


then he would turn off the light


and pull the black curtain
away…
sometimes I was able to retrieve one
of the items
but eventually they all returned
forever.


also, I found out that the one thing


you could sell in the bars and on the
street were
hock shop tickets.


the hock shops helped me through some terrible times and I was glad they were there when nothing else
was, and that booth with the black
curtain: what a marvelous sanctuary,
a place to give up something for
something else that you needed
much more.


how many typewriters, suits, gloves and


watches I left in the hock shops
I have no
idea,
but those places were always
all right
with me.


hell is a closed door












even when starving


the rejection slips hardly ever bothered me: I only believed that the editors were truly stupid
and I just went on and wrote more and
more.
I even considered rejects as
action; the worst was the empty
mailbox.


if I had a weakness or a dream


it was
that I only wanted to see one of these
editors
who rejected me,
to see his or her face, the way they
dressed, the way they walked across a
room, the sound of their voice, the look
in their eye…
just one look at one of
them—


you see, when all you look at is


a piece of printed paper
telling you that you
aren’t very good,
then there is a tendency
to think that the editors
are more god-like than
they are.


hell is a closed door
when you’re starving for your goddamned art


but sometimes you feel at least like having a


peek through the
keyhole.
young or old, good or bad,
I don’t think anything dies as slow and
as hard as a
writer.


pulled down shade












what I like about you


she told me
is that you’re crude—
look at you sitting there
a beercan in your hand
and a cigar in your mouth
and look at
your dirty hairy belly
sticking out from
under your shirt.
you’ve got your shoes off
and you’ve got a hole
in your right stocking
with the big toe
sticking out.
you haven’t shaved in
4 or 5 days.
your teeth are yellow
and your eyebrows
hang down
all twisted
and you’ve got enough
scars
to scare the shit
out of anybody.
there’s always
a ring
in your bathtub
your telephone
is covered with
grease
and
half the crap in
your refrigerator is


rotten.
you never
wash your car.


you’ve got newspapers


a week old
on the floor.
you read dirty
magazines
and you don’t have
a tv
but you order
deliveries from the
liquor store
and you tip
good.
and best of all
you don’t push
a woman to
go to bed
with you.
you seem hardly
interested


and when I talk to you


you don’t
say anything
you just
look around
the room or
scratch your
neck
like you don’t
hear me.
you’ve got an old
wet towel in
the sink
and a photo of
Mussolini
on the wall
and you never


complain
about anything
and you never
ask questions
and I’ve
known you for


* months but I have no idea who you are. you’re like some


pulled down shade but that’s what


I like about you:
your crudeness: a woman can drop


out of your life and forget you real fast. a woman
can’t go anywhere but UP
after leaving you, honey. you’ve got to be


the best thing that ever happened to
a girl
who’s between one guy
and the next


and has nothing


to do
at the moment.


this fucking
Scotch is
great.
let’s play
Scrabble.


before Aids












I’m glad I got to them


all, I’m glad I got so many of them
in.


I flipped them


poked them
gored them.


so many high-heeled shoes


under my bed
it looked like a January
Clearance Sale.


the cheap hotel rooms,


the drunken fights,
the phones ringing,
the walls banging


* was wild red-eyed big-balled unshaven poor foul-mouthed


* laughed plenty


and I picked them off


the barstools
like
ripe plums.


dirty sheets


bad whiskey
bad breath
cheap cigars
and to hell with the next
morning.


I always slept with my


wallet under my
pillow
bedded down with the
depressed and the
crazies.


I was barred from half the


hotels in
Los Angeles.


I’m glad I got to them all,


I plugged and banged and
sang and
some of them
sang with me
on those glorious
3 a.m. mornings.
when the cops
arrived, that was
grand,
we barricaded the doors
and taunted
them


and they never waited around


until noon
(checking-out time) to
arrest us,
we weren’t that
important


but


I thought we were
walking toward the bar,


and what a place the bar was


around noon, so quiet and


empty,
a place to begin
again,
to buck up with a quiet
beer,
looking out across at the
park
with the ducks over there
and the tall trees
over there.


so,


always broke but always
money from somewhere,


* waited getting ready to


plug and bang and poke and sing again


in those good old times in those very very very good old times before Aids.


hunk of rock










Nina was the hardest of them


all,
the worst woman I had known
up to that moment
and I was sitting in front of
my secondhand black and white
tv
watching the news
when I heard a suspicious
sound in the kitchen
and I ran out there
and saw her with
a full bottle of whiskey—
a 5th—
and she had it and
was headed for the back porch
door
but I caught her and
grabbed at the bottle.
“give me that bottle, you
fucking whore!”
and we wrestled for the
bottle
and let me tell you
she gave me a good fight
for it
but
I got it away from her
and I told her to
get her ass out of
there.
she lived in the same place
in the back
upstairs.


I locked the door


took the bottle and a


glass
went out to the couch


sat down and
opened the bottle and


poured myself a good


one.


I shut off the tv and


sat there
thinking about what a


hard number
Nina was.
I came up with
at least
a dozen lousy things


she had done
to me.


what a whore.


what a hunk of rock.


I sat there drinking


the whiskey
and wondering
what I was doing
with Nina.


then there was a


knock on the
door.


it was Nina’s friend,


Helga.


“where’s Nina?”
she asked.


“she tried to steal


my whiskey, I
ran her ass
out of here.”
“she said to meet
her here.”


“what for?”


“she said me and her


were going to do it
in front of you
for $50.”


“$25.”


“she said $50.”


“well, she’s not


here…want a
drink?”


“sure…”


I got Helga a glass


poured her a
whiskey.
she took a
hit.


“maybe,” she said,


“I ought to go get
Nina.”


“I don’t want to see
her.”


“why not?”


“she’s a whore.”


Helga finished her


drink and I poured
her another.
she took a
hit.


“Benny calls me a


whore, I’m no
whore.”


Benny was the guy


she was shacked
with.


“I know you’re no


whore, Helga.”


“thanks. Ain’t ya got no


music?”


“just the radio…”


she saw it


got up
turned it
on.
some music came
blaring out.


Helga began to


dance
holding her whiskey


glass in one
hand.
she wasn’t a good
dancer
she looked
ridiculous.


she stopped


drained her drink
rolled her glass along the


rug
then ran toward
me
dropped to her knees
unzipped me
and then
she was down
there
doing tricks.


I drained my


drink
poured another.


she was


good.
she had a college
degree
some place back
East.


“get it, Helga, get


it!”


there was a loud


knock
on the front
door.


“HANK, IS HELGA


THERE?”


“WHO?”


“HELGA!”


“JUST A MINUTE!”


“THIS IS NINA, I WAS


SUPPOSED TO MEET
HELGA HERE, WE HAVE A


LITTLE SURPRISE FOR


YOU!”


“YOU TRIED TO STEAL


MY WHISKEY, YOU


WHORE!”


“HANK, LET ME


IN!”


“get it, Helga, get


it!”


“HANK!”


“Helga, you fucking whore…


Helga! Helga! Helga!!”


I pulled away and


got up.


“let her in.”
I went to the


bathroom.


when I came out they


were both sitting there


drinking and smoking


laughing about
something.
then they
saw me.


“50 bucks,” said Nina.




“25 bucks,” I said.


“we won’t do it
then.”


“don’t then.”


Nina inhaled


exhaled.
“all right, you
cheap bastard, 25
bucks!”


Nina stood up and


began taking her
clothes off.


she was the hardest


of them
all.


Helga stood up and


began taking her
clothes off.
I poured a


drink.
“sometimes I wonder


what the hell is
going on
around here,” I
said.


“don’t worry about


it, Daddy, just
get with it!”


“just what am I


supposed to
do?”
“just do
whatever the fuck
you feel
like doing,”
said Nina
her big ass
blazing
in the
lamplight.


poetry










it


takes
a lot of


desperation


dissatisfaction


and


disillusion


to


write


a


few
good
poems.


it’s not


for
everybody


either to


write


it


or even to


read
it.


dinner, 1933












when my father ate


his lips became
greasy
with food.


and when he ate


he talked about how
good
the food was
and that
most other people
didn’t eat
as good
as we
did.


he liked to


sop up
what was left
on his plate
with a piece of
bread,
meanwhile making
appreciative sounds
rather like
half-grunts.


he slurped his


coffee
making loud
bubbling
sounds.
then he’d put


the cup
down:
“dessert? is it
jello?”


my mother would


bring it
in a large bowl


and my father would


spoon it
out.


as it plopped


in the dish
the jello made
strange sounds,
almost fart-like
sounds.


then came the


whipped cream,
mounds of it
on the
jello.


“ah! jello and


whipped cream!”


my father sucked the


jello and whipped
cream
off his spoon—
it sounded as if it
was entering a
wind
tunnel.
finished with


that
he would wipe his
mouth
with a huge white
napkin,
rubbing hard
in circular
motions,
the napkin almost
hiding his
entire
face.


after that


out came the
Camel
cigarettes.
he’d light one
with a wooden
kitchen match,
then place the
match,
still burning,
onto an
ashtray.


then a slurp of


coffee, the cup
back down, and a good


drag on the
Camel.


“ah that was a


good
meal!”


moments later
in my bedroom


on my bed
in the dark
the food that I
had eaten
and what I had


seen
was already
making me
ill.


the only good


thing
was
listening to
the crickets
out there,
out there


in another world


* didn’t live in.


such luck












we were at this table,


men and women,
after dinner.
somehow
the conversation got
around to
PMS.
one of the ladies
stated firmly that
the only cure for
PMS
was old
age.
there were other
remarks
that I have
forgotten,
except for one
which came from this
German guest
once married,
now divorced.
also, I had seen
him with
any number of
beautiful young
girlfriends.
anyhow, after quietly
listening
to our conversation
for some time
he asked us,
“what’s PMS?”


now here was one


truly touched
by
the angels.


the light was so


bright
we
all looked
away.


flophouse












you haven’t lived


until you’ve been in a
flophouse
with nothing but one
light bulb
and 56 men
squeezed together
on cots
with everybody
snoring
at once
and some of those
snores
so
deep and
gross and
unbelievable—
dark
snotty
gross
subhuman
wheezings
from hell
itself.


your mind


almost breaks
under those
death-like
sounds


and the
intermingling


odors:
hard


unwashed socks


pissed and
shitted
underwear


and over it all


slowly circulating


air
much like that
emanating from
uncovered
garbage
cans.


and those


bodies
in the dark


fat and


thin
and
bent


some


legless
armless


some


mindless


and worst of


all:
the total
absence of
hope


it shrouds


them
covers them
totally.
it’s not
bearable.


you get


up


go out


walk the


streets


up and


down
sidewalks


past buildings




around the


corner


and back


up
the same
street


thinking


those men


were all
children
once
what has happened


to
them?


and what has


happened
to
me?
it’s dark
and cold
out
here.


hand-outs












sometimes I am hit


for change
3 or 4 times
in twenty minutes
and nine times out of
ten I’ll
give.
the time or two
that I don’t
I have an instinctive
reaction
not to
and I
don’t
but mostly I
dig and
give
but each time
I can’t help but
remember
the many times
hollow-eyed
my skin tight to the
ribs
my mind airy and
mad
I never asked
anybody
for anything
and it wasn’t
pride
it was simply because
I didn’t respect
them


didn’t regard them


as worthy human


beings.
they were the
enemy
and they still are
as I dig
in
and
give.


waiting










hot summers in the mid-30’s in Los Angeles where every 3rd lot was vacant and it was a short ride to the orange


groves—
if you had a car and the
gas.


hot summers in the mid-30’s in Los Angeles too young to be a man and too old to be a boy.


hard times.


a neighbor tried to rob our
house, my father caught him
climbing through the
window,
held him there in the dark
on the floor:
“you rotten son of a
bitch!”


“Henry, Henry, let me go,


let me go!”


“you son of a bitch, I’ll kill


you!”


my mother phoned the police.


another neighbor set his house on fire


in an attempt to collect the
insurance.


he was investigated and
jailed.


hot summers in the mid-30’s in Los Angeles, nothing to do, nowhere to go, listening to the terrified talk of our parents at night:


“what will we do? what will we
do?”


“god, I don’t know…”


starving dogs in the alleys, skin taut


across ribs, hair falling out, tongues
out, such sad eyes, sadder than any sadness on earth.


hot summers in the mid-30’s in Los Angeles, the men of the neighborhood were quiet and the women were like pale statues.


the parks full of socialists,


communists, anarchists, standing on the park benches, orating, agitating.


the sun came down through a clear sky and


the ocean was clean
and we were
neither men nor
boys.


we fed the dogs leftover pieces of dry hard bread
which they ate gratefully,
eyes shining in
wonder,


tails waving at such
luck


as


World War II moved toward us,
even then, during those


hot summers in the mid-30’s in Los Angeles.


those mornings












I still remember those New Orleans rats


out on the balcony railings
in the dark of early morning
as I stood waiting my turn at the
crapper.
there were always two or three
big ones
just sitting there—sometimes they’d
move quickly then
stop and sit there.
I looked at them and they looked at
me.
they showed no fear.


at last the crapper door would open


and out would walk
one of the tenants
and he always looked worse than
the rats
and then he’d be gone
down the hallway
and I’d go into the still-stinking
crapper
with my hangover.


and almost always


when I came out
the rats would be gone.
as soon as it got a little light
they would
vanish.
and then


the world would be
mine,


I’d walk down the stairway


and into it
and my low-wage
pitiful
job
while remembering the
rats,


how it was better for them


than for
me.


I walked to work as the sun


came up hot
and the whores slept
like
babies.


everything you touch










putting on your torn clothes in an old New Orleans roominghouse, you and your stockboy soul,


then rolling your little green wagon past the salesgirls who took no notice of you, those girls dreaming of bigger game with their tiny rectangular brains.


or in Los Angeles, coming in from your shipping clerk job at an auto parts warehouse, taking the elevator up to 319 to find your woman sprawled out on the bed, drunk at 6 p.m.


you were never any good at picking them, you always got the leftovers, the crazies, the alkies, the pill-freaks.


maybe that was all you could get and maybe you were all they could get.


you went to the bars and found more alkies, pill-freaks, crazies. all they had to show you were a pair of well-turned ankles in spike-heeled shoes.
you thumped up and down on beds with them as if you had discovered


the meaning of
existence.


then there was this day at work when Larry the salesman came down the


aisle with his big belly and his little button eyes, Larry always walked loudly on leather-soled shoes and he was almost always whistling.


he stopped whistling and stood at your shipping table as you worked.


then he began rocking back and forth, he had this habit and


he stood there rocking, observing you, he was one of those jokers, you know, and then he began laughing, you were sick from a long crazy night, needed a shave, you were dressed in a torn shirt.


“what is it, Larry?” you asked.


and then he said, “Hank, everything you touch turns to shit!”




you couldn’t argue with him about that.


car wash










got out, fellow said, “hey!” walked toward me, we shook hands, he slipped me 2 red tickets for free car washes, “find you later,” I told him, walked on through to waiting area with wife, we sat on outside bench. black fellow with a limp came up, said, “hey, man, how’s it going?”
I answered, “fine, bro, you makin’ it?” “no problem,” he said, then walked off to dry down a Caddy.


“these people know you?” my wife asked.


“no.”
“how come they talk to you?”


“they like me, people have always liked me, it’s my cross.”
then our car was finished, fellow flipped
his rag at me, we got up, got to the
car, I slipped him a buck, we got in, I
started the engine, the foreman walked
up, big guy with dark shades, huge guy,


he smiled a big one, “good to see you,
man!”


I smiled back, “thanks, but it’s your party, man!”


I pulled out into traffic, “they know you,” said my wife.
“sure,” I said, “I’ve been there.”


the flashing of the odds












parking lot attendant, Bobby, was funny,


wise-cracking, laughing, was
good at it, he was an original,
sometimes when I was down
listening to Bobby brought me back
up.


didn’t see him for 3 weeks, asked the


other attendants but they didn’t know
or made things up.


drove in today and there was


Bobby, his uniform wrinkled, he was just standing there while the others worked.


approached him and he seemed to


recognize me, then spoke: “got all
stressed out driving here, it took me
3 hours!”


he wasn’t laughing, had grown suddenly


fat, his belt buckle was
unfastened, I buckled him up, he
had a 3 day beard,
his
hair was grey, his face wrinkled, his
eyes stuck in a backwash, 20 years
lost in 3 weeks.


“good to see you, Bobby.”
“yeah, sure, when you going to buy


this place?”


he was talking about the


racetrack.
I walked across the lot and into
the track, took the escalator


up, reached the top floor, walked


toward the service stand.
Betty saw me and got my coffee


poured.


“you ready for a big day?”


she asked.


“I’m ready for any kind of


day.”


“you come here to win, don’t


you?”


“I come here not to


lose.”


I took my coffee to a seat


facing the toteboard.
the odds flashed, I sat down
spilling hot coffee
on my
hand.


“shit,” I said.


and the day went


on.

near the corner table in the


cafe
a middle-aged couple
sit.
they have finished their
meal
and they are each drinking a
beer.
it is 9 in the evening.
she is smoking a
cigarette.
then he says something.
she nods.
then she speaks.
he grins, moves his
hand.
then they are
quiet.
through the blinds next to
their table
flashing red neon
blinks on and
off.


there is no war.


there is no hell.


then he raises his beer


bottle.
it is green.
he lifts it to his lips,
tilts it.


it is a coronet.


her right elbow is


on the table
and in her hand
she holds the
cigarette
between her thumb and


forefinger
and
as she watches
him
the streets outside
flower
in the
night.


the bluebird










there’s a bluebird in my heart that


wants to get out
but I’m too tough for him,
I say, stay in there, I’m not going
to let anybody see
you.


there’s a bluebird in my heart that


wants to get out
but I pour whiskey on him and inhale
cigarette smoke
and the whores and the bartenders
and the grocery clerks
never know that
he’s
in there.


there’s a bluebird in my heart that


wants to get out
but I’m too tough for him,
I say,
stay down, do you want to mess
me up?
you want to screw up the
works?
you want to blow my book sales in
Europe?


there’s a bluebird in my heart that


wants to get out
but I’m too clever, I only let him out
at night sometimes
when everybody’s asleep.


I say, I know that you’re there,


so don’t be
sad.
then I put him back,
but he’s singing a little
in there, I haven’t quite let him


die
and we sleep together like
that
with our
secret pact
and it’s nice enough to
make a man
weep, but I don’t
weep, do
you?


living too long takes more than time


going out












the sweet slide of the luger


toward your temple,
a flight of birds winging
northward,
the clicking sound of the
safety catch being
released,
the eclipse of the
sun,
the sound of something being
shut
hard,
pal.


the replacements












Jack London drinking his life away while writing of strange and heroic men. Eugene O’Neill drinking himself oblivious while writing his dark and poetic works.


now our moderns


lecture at universities
in tie and suit,
the little boys soberly studious,
the little girls with glazed eyes
looking
up,
the lawns so green, the books so dull,
the life so dying of
thirst.


the genius












this man sometimes forgets who


he is.
sometimes he thinks he’s the
Pope.


other times he thinks he’s a


hunted rabbit
and hides under the
bed.


then


all at once
he’ll recapture total
clarity
and begin creating
works of
art.


then he’ll be all right


for some
time.


then, say,


he’ll be sitting with his
wife
and 3 or 4 other
people
discussing various
matters


he will be charming,


incisive,
original.


then he’ll do


something
strange.
like once
he stood up
unzipped
and began
pissing
on the
rug.


another time


he ate a paper
napkin.


and there was


the time
he got into his
car
and drove it
backwards
all the way to
the
grocery store
and back
again
backwards


the other motorists


screaming at
him
but he
made it
there and
back
without
incident
and without


being
stopped
by a patrol
car.
but he’s best
as the
Pope
and his
Latin
is very
good.


his works of


art
aren’t that
exceptional


but they allow him


to
survive
and to live with
a series of
19-year-old
wives
who
cut his hair
his toenails
bib
tuck and
feed
him.


he wears everybody


out
but
himself.


a poet in New York










eating out tonight


I find a table alone
and while waiting for my order
take out my wife’s copy of
A Poet in New York.
I often carry things to read
so that I will not have to look at
the people.


I find the poems bad (for me)


these poems written in 1929
the year of the stock market
crash.


I close the book and look at


the people.


my order arrives.


the food is bad too.


some say that bad and good


run in streaks.


I hope so.


I wait for the good, put a slice of
lemon chicken into my
mouth, chew
and pretend that everything is
fairly
fine.


no sale












I just sat in the bar


non compos mentis.


it was about a week before


Xmas.
big Ed was selling trees
outside.


he came into the


bar.


“Jesus, it’s freezing out


there!”


big Ed looked at me.


“Hank, you go stand out there


with the trees.
if anybody wants to buy
one, you come in and
get me.”


I stood outside.


I was in my shirt sleeves.


I didn’t have a coat.
it was snowing.
it was ice cold
but a nice ice
cold.
I wasn’t used to snow
but I liked the snow.


I stood with the trees.


I stood there about 20


minutes
then big Ed came
out.


“nobody come by?”


“no, Ed.”


“you go on in, tell Billy Boy


to give you a drink on
my tab.”


I walked in


got a stool.


I told Billy Boy,


“double scotch and water,


Ed’s tab.”


Billy Boy poured.


“you sell any trees?”


“no trees.”


Billy Boy looked at


the patrons.


“hey, Hank didn’t sell


no trees.”


“whatsa matter, Hank?”


somebody asked.


I didn’t answer.


I took a hit of my
drink.


“how come no trees were


sold?” somebody else
asked.
“as the bee swarms to
honey, as night follows
day
in the stink of time,
it will
happen.”


“what will happen?”


“somebody will sell a tree


though it won’t necessarily


be me.”


I finished my drink.


there was


silence.


then somebody said,


“this guy is some kind of
nut.”


being there


with those
* decided

with


that.


this










self-congratulatory nonsense as the


famous gather to applaud their seeming


greatness


you


wonder where
the real ones are


what


giant cave
hides them


as


the deathly talentless
bow to
accolades


as


the fools are
fooled
again


you


wonder where
the real ones are


if there are


real ones.


this


self-congratulatory nonsense
has lasted


decades
and
with some exceptions


centuries.


this
is so dreary


is so absolutely pitiless


it


churns the gut to
powder
shackles hope


it


makes little things
like
pulling up a shade
or
putting on your shoes
or


walking out on the street


more difficult


near
damnable


as


the famous gather to
applaud their
seeming
greatness


as


the fools are

humanity


you sick
motherfucker.


now












to reach here


gliding into old age
the decades gone


without ever meeting one person


truly evil
without ever meeting one person


truly exceptional
without ever meeting one person


truly good


gliding into old age


the decades gone


the mornings are the worst.


in error










a warrior


I come in from a long but
victorious day
at the track.


she greets me with some


trash
which I carry and dump
into the garbage
can.


“Jesus Christ,” she says,


“push the lid down tight!
the ants will be
everywhere!”


I push the lid down tight.


I think of Amsterdam.


I think of pigeons flying from a
roof.
I think of Time dangling from
a
paper clip.


she’s right, of course: the lid


should be
tight.


I walk slowly back


into
the


house.


confession












waiting for death


like a cat
that will jump on the
bed


I am so very sorry for


my wife


she will see this


stiff
white
body


shake it once, then


maybe
again:


“Hank!”


Hank won’t


answer.


it’s not my death that


worries me, it’s my wife
left with this
pile of
nothing.


I want to


let her know
though
that all the nights


sleeping
beside her


even the useless


arguments
were things
ever splendid


and the hard


words
I ever feared to
say
can now be
said:


* love you.


mugged










finished,


can’t find the handle,
mugged in the backalleys of nowhere,
too many dark days and nights,
too many unkind noons, plus a
steady fixation for
the ladies of death.


I am


finished. roll me
up, package
me,
toss me
to the birds of Normandy or the
gulls of Santa Monica, I
no longer
read
I
no longer
breed,
I
talk to old men over quiet
fences.


is this where my suicide complex


uncomplexes?:
as
I am asked over the telephone:
did you ever know Kerouac?


I now allow cars to pass me on the freeway.


I haven’t been in a fist fight for 15 years.
I have to get up and piss 3 times a night.




and when I see a sexpot on the street I


only see
trouble.
I am
finished, back to square one,
drinking alone and listening to classical


music.


much about dying is getting ready.


the tiger walks through my dreams.
the cigarette in my mouth just exploded.


curious things still do


occur.


no, I never knew Kerouac.


so you see:


my life wasn’t
useless
after
all.


the writer










when I think of the things I endured trying to be a writer—all those rooms in all those cities, nibbling on tiny bits of food that wouldn’t keep a rat


alive.


I was so thin I could slice bread with my


shoulderblades, only I seldom had
bread…
meanwhile, writing things down
again and again
on pieces of paper.


and when I moved from one place to


another
my cardboard suitcase was just
that: paper outside stuffed with
paper inside.
each new landlady would
ask, “what do you
do?”


“I’m a writer.”


“oh…”


as I settled into tiny rooms to evoke my


craft
many of them pitied me, gave me little
tidbits like apples, walnuts,
peaches…
little did they know
that that


was about all that I
ate.
but their pity ended when
they found cheap wine bottles in my
place.


it’s all right to be a starving writer


but not
a starving writer who
drinks.
drunks are never forgiven
anything.


but when the world is closing in very


fast
a bottle of wine seems a very
reasonable friend.


ah. all those landladies,


most of them heavy, slow, their husbands long dead, I can still see those dears


climbing up and down the stairways of


their world.


they ruled my very existence:


without them allowing me
an extra week on the rent
now and then,
I was out on the
street


and I couldn’t WRITE


on the street.
it was very important to have a
room, a door, those
walls.


oh, those dark mornings


in those beds
listening to their footsteps
listening to them cough
hearing the flushing of their
toilets, smelling the cooking of
their food
while waiting
for some word


on my submissions to New York City


and the world,
my submissions to those educated,


intelligent, snobbish, inbred,
formal, comfortable people
out there


they truly took their time to


say, no.


yes, in those dark beds


with the landladies rustling about
puttering and snooping, sharpening


utensils,
I often thought of those editors and


publishers out there
who didn’t recognize
what I was trying to say
in my special
way


and I thought, they must be


wrong.


then this would be followed


with a thought much worse
than that:
I could be a


fool:


almost every writer thinks


they are doing
exceptional work.
that’s
normal.


being a fool is


normal.


and then I’d


get out of bed
find a piece of
paper
and start
writing
again.


they don’t eat like us










my father eating.


his ears moved.


he munched with great vigor.


I wished him in hell.


I watched the fork in his hand.


I watched it put food into his mouth.


the food I ate was tasteless and deadly.


his small bits of conversation entered my head.
the words ran down my spine.
they spilled into my shoes.


“eat your food, Henry,” my mother said.


he said, “many people are starving and don’t eat as well as us!”




I wished him in hell.


I watched his fork.
it gathered more food and put it into his mouth.
he chewed in a dog-like fashion.
his ears moved.


the brutal beatings he gave me I was ready for.


but watching him eat brought on the darkness.
there at the tablecloth.
there with the green and blue wooden napkin holders.
“eat your food or I’ll strop your god damned ass,” he told me.




later in life I made him pay somewhat.


but he still owes me.


and I’ll never collect.


let me tell you












hell is built


piece by piece
brick by brick
around
you.
it’s a gradual,
not a rapid
process.


we build our


own
inferno,
blame
others.


but hell is


hell.


wordly hell is


hell.


my hell and


your
hell.


our


hell.


hell, hell,


hell.
the song of


hell.


putting your


shoes on
in the
morning.
hell.


blasted apart with the first breath










running out of days


as the banister glints
in the early morning sun.


there will be no rest


even in our dreams.


now, all there is to do is


reset
broken moments.


when even to exist seems a


victory
then surely our luck has
run thin


thinner than a bloody stream


toward death.


life is a sad song:


we have heard too many
voices
seen too many
faces
too many
bodies


worst have been the faces:


a dirty joke that no one
can understand.
barbaric, senseless days total


in your skull;
reality is a juiceless
orange.
there is no plan
no out
no divinity
no sparrow of
joy.


we can’t compare life to


anything—that’s
too dreary a
prospect.


relatively speaking,


we were never short on
courage


but, at best, the odds


remained long
and
at worst,
unchangeable.


and what was worst:


not that we wasted
it
but that it was
wasted
on us:


coming out of


the Womb
trapped
in light and
darkness
stricken and numbed


alone in the temperate zone of


dumb agony
now


running out of days


as the banister glints
in the early morning sun.

the boy was going to take the bus out


to see the
Graceland Mansion


then


the Greyhound Lines went
on strike.


there were only two clerks


and two lines
at the station
and the lines were
50 to 65 people
long.


after two hours in line


one of the clerks told the
boy
that his bus
would leave
as soon as the substitute
driver arrived.


“when will that be?” the


boy asked.


“we can’t


be certain,” the
clerk answered.


the boy slept on the floor
that night


but by 9 a.m.
the next morning
the substitute driver
still had not
arrived.
the boy had to wait
in another line
to get to the
toilet.


he finally got a


stall, carefully
fitted the
sanitary toilet seat
paper cover,
pulled down his
pants,
his shorts
and
sat down.


luckily


the boy had a
pencil.


he found a clean


space
among all the


smeared and demented


scrawlings and
drawings


and very


carefully
and
heavily
he printed:


HEARTBREAK HOTEL


then he dropped the


first
one.


my buddy in valet parking at the racetrack:










after 9 long races among greedy faces


on a hot Sunday that hardly rhymes with


reason
I have murdered another day,


come out with shoelaces flopping (while


secretly craving to be in a moss-lined


cave, say,
watching black and white cartoons
while wanton simplicity soothes the
muddled brain)
as my buddy the valet races the
machine up, revving the 8-year-old
engine, he leaps
out:
“how ya doin’, baby?”


“things have me by the jugular, Frank,


I’m ready to run up the white
flag.”
“not you, baby, you’re my
leader!”
“you can do better than that,
Frank…”


I get in, hook the seat belt, put on


the driving glasses, put it in first…


“hey, man,” he sticks his head into the


window, “let’s go out and get drunk and


kick some ass and find some
pussy!”


I tell him, “I’ll consider that.”


as I pull out I can see him in the rearview mirror: he’s giving me the finger.


I smile for the first time in 7 or


8 hours.


see here, you












blazing bastard fools

with your

you are so

you


soft lumps of
humanity


you


imitators of
other
pretenders


you are still


in
the shadow of
the
Mother


you


have never

the

you have never

the full flavor of
Hell


you have never

you have never

with the
razor-sharp

you


blazing bastard fools


with your

there is nothing

no place

your


lives
your
deaths
your

useless


disgusting

spark










I always resented all the years, the hours, the minutes I gave them as a working stiff, it actually hurt my head, my insides, it made me dizzy and a bit crazy—I couldn’t understand the murdering of my years


yet my fellow workers gave no signs of
agony, many of them even seemed satisfied, and seeing them that way drove me almost as crazy as the dull and senseless work.


the workers submitted.


the work pounded them to nothingness, they were scooped-out and thrown away.


I resented each minute, every minute as it was mutilated
and nothing relieved the monotony.


I considered suicide.


I drank away my few leisure hours.


I worked for decades.


I lived with the worst kind of women, they killed what the job failed to kill.


I knew that I was dying.


something in me said, go ahead, die, sleep, become as them, accept.


then something else in me said, no, save the tiniest
bit.


it needn’t be much, just a spark.


a spark can set a whole forest on


fire.
just a spark.
save it.
I think I did.
I’m glad I did.
what a lucky god damned
thing.


the science of physiognomy












long gone along the way, faces


grey and white and black and brown, and eyes, all color of eyes.


eyes are odd, I have lived with a woman, at least one, where the sex was fair, the conversation passable and sometimes there was even a seeming love


but then I suddenly noticed the eyes, saw there the dark smeared walls of a stinking hell.


(of course, I am pleased that I do not often have to see my own eyes, lips, hair, ears, so forth—
I avoid the mirror with a studied
regularity.)


long gone along the way, he had a face like a mole pie, fat and unshivering and he walked up to me in the railroad yards, I was beastly sick


and that flesh plate shook my innards, my psycho-kid insides as he said, “I’m waiting on my pay-check,


I been squeezing this nickel so hard that the buffalo is screaming.” he showed me the nickel.
tough, but no beer, I walked away from him,
my face white like a bright headlight, I walked


away from him and toward the faces of the nonwhites


who
hated me with a natural
ease.
long gone along the way, the landladies’ faces, doomed, powdered, old lilac faces, old lovely dolls with husbands so long gone, the agony diminished but still there as I followed them up stairways nearly a century old to some cubicle of a room and I always told them, “ah, a very nice room…”; to pay


then, close the door, undress, lay upon that bed and turn out the light (it was always early evening) and then soon to hear the same sound: the scurry of my old friends: either the roaches or the mice or the rats.


long gone along the way, now I wonder about Inez


and Irene and their sky-blue eyes and their wonderful


legs and breasts
but mostly
their faces, faces carved out of a marble that
sometimes the gods
bestow and


Inez and Irene sat in front of me in class and learned about algebra, the shortest distance between two points, the Treaty of Versailles, about Attila the Hun and etc.
and I watched them and wondered what they were
thinking?
nothing much,
probably.
and I wonder where they are tonight


with their faces these 5 decades and 2 years later?


the skin which covers the bone, the eyes that smile; quick, turn out the light, let the dark dance…


the most beautiful face I ever saw was that of a paperman, a newsboy, the old fellow so long gone down the way
who sat at a stand at Beverly and Vermont,
his head, his face looked like what they


called him: The Frog Man. I saw him
often but we seldom spoke and
The Frog Man died suddenly
and was gone
but I will always remember him
and one night
I came out of a nearby bar,
he was there at his stand and


he looked at me and said, “you and I, we know the same things.”


I nodded, put both thumbs up, and that big Frog


face, the big Frog head lifted in the moonlight
and began laughing the most terrible and real
laughter I have ever
heard.


long gone along the way


victory










what bargains we have made


we have
kept
and
as the dogs of the hours
close in
nothing
can be taken
from us
but
our lives.


Edward Sbragia










puffing on tiny cigarette butts as the world washes to the


shore I
burn my
dumb lips
think of
Manfred Freiherr von Richthofen
und sein
Fliegerzirkus.


as my cat sits in the bathroom window I


light a new
stub


as Norway winks and the dogs of hell pray for me


downstairs my wife studies the


Italian
language.


up here


I would give half my ass for a
decent
smoke…


I


sneeze
then
jump: a little red coal of ash has dropped onto my
white white
belly—I
dig the fiery bit out with my
fingers:


a bit of minor
pain
I type naked: see my sulking soul
now
with a little pink
dot.


you see, I have my own show going on up here, I don’t need Vegas or cable tv,
the label on my wine bottle states
in part:


“…our winemaker, Edward Sbragia, has retained the fresh, fruity character of the Pinot Noir and Napa Gamay grapes…”


the dogs of hell pray for me as the


world washes to the
shore.


wandering in the cage










languid conjecture during hours of moil, trapped in the shadows of the father.
sidewalks outside of cafes are lonely
through the day.


my cat looks at me and is not sure what I am and I look back and am pleased to feel the same
about him…


reading 2 issues of a famous magazine of 40 years ago, the writing that I felt was bad then, I still feel
is
that way


and none of the writers have lasted.


sometimes there is a strange justice


working
somewhere.


sometimes


not…


grammar school was the first awakening of a long hell to come:
meeting other beings as horrible as my
parents.


something I never thought
possible…


when I won the medal for Manual of Arms in the R.O.T.C.
I wasn’t interested in
winning.


I wasn’t much interested in anything, even the girls seemed a bad game
to chase: all too much for all too
little


at night before sleeping I often considered what I would do, what I would be:


bank robber, drunk, beggar, idiot, common laborer.


I settled on idiot and common laborer, it seemed more comfortable than any of the alternatives…
the best thing about near-starvation and hunger is


that when you finally
eat
it is such a beautiful and delicious and
magical thing.


people who eat 3 meals a day throughout life have never really
tasted
food…


people are strange: they are constantly angered by trivial things,
but on a major matter
like
totally wasting their lives,
they hardly seem to
notice…
on writers: I found out that most of them swam together.
there were schools, establishments,
theories.
groups gathered and fought each
other.
there was literary politics.
there was game-playing and
bitterness.


I always thought writing was a


solitary profession.


still do…


animals never worry about


Heaven or Hell.


neither do


I.


maybe that’s why


we
get along…


when lonely people come around


I soon can understand why
other people leave them
alone.


and that which would be a


blessing to
me


is a horror to


them…
poor poor Celine.


he only wrote one book.
forget the others.
but what a book it was:
Voyage au bout de la nuit.
it took everything out of
him.
it left him a hopscotch
odd-ball
skittering through the
fog of
eventuality…


the United States is a very strange


place: it reached its apex in
1970
and since then
for every year
it has regressed


* years, until now in 1989 it is 1930


in the way of doing things.


you don’t have to go to the movies


to see a horror
show.


there is a madhouse near the post office


where I mail my works
out.


I never park in front of the post office,


I park in front of the madhouse
and walk down.
I walk past the madhouse.


some of the lesser mad are allowed


out on the porch.
they sit like
pigeons.


I feel a brotherhood with


them.
but I don’t sit with them.


I walk down and drop my works


in the first class slot.


I am supposed to know what I am


doing.


I walk back, look at them and


don’t look at
them.


I get in my car and drive


off.


I am allowed to drive a


car.


I drive it all the way back to my


house.


I drive my car up the driveway,


thinking,
what am I doing?


I get out of my car


and one of my 5 cats walks up to


me, he is a very fine
fellow.


I reach down and touch


him.


then I feel all right.


I am exactly what I am supposed to


be.


the pack












the dogs are at it again; they leap and


tear, back off, circle, then
attack again.


and I had thought this was over, I had


thought that they had
forgotten; now there are only
more of them.


and I am older,


now


but the dogs are


ageless


and as always they tear not only at


the flesh but also at
the mind and the spirit.


now


they are circling me
in this room.


they are not


beautiful; they are the dogs
from hell


and they will find you


too


even though you are one
of them


now.


question and answer












he sat naked and drunk in a room of summer night, running the blade of the knife under his fingernails, smiling, thinking of all the letters he had received


telling him that
the way he lived and wrote about
that—
it had kept them going when
all seemed
truly
hopeless.


putting the blade on the table, he


flicked it with a finger
and it whirled
in a flashing circle
under the light.


who the hell is going to save


me? he
thought.


as the knife stopped spinning


the answer came:
you’re going to have to
save yourself.


still smiling,


1. he lit a cigarette


2. he poured another
drink


3. gave the blade another


spin.


fan letter










I been readin’ you for a long time now,


I just put Billy Boy to bed,
he got 7 mean ticks from somewhere,
I got 2,
my husband, Benny, he got 3.
some of us love bugs, others hate
them.
Benny writes poems.
he was in the same magazine as you
once.
Benny is the world’s greatest writer
but he got this temper.
he gave a readin’ once and somebody
laughed at one of his serious poems
and Benny took his thing out right
there
and pissed on stage.
he says you write good but that you
couldn’t carry his balls in a paper
bag.
anyhow, I made a BIG POT OF MARMALADE tonight,
we all just LOVE marmalade here.
Benny lost his job yesterday, he told his
boss to stick it up his ass
but I still got my job down at the
manicure shop.
you know fags come in to get their nails
done?
you aren’t a fag, are you, Mr.
Chinaski?
anyhow, I just felt like writing you.
your books are read and read around
here.


Benny says you’re an old fart, you
write pretty good but that you
couldn’t carry his balls in a
paper sack.
do you like bugs, Mr. Chinaski?


I think the marmalade is cool enough to


eat now.
so goodbye.


Dora


hold on, it’s a belly laugh












it would be good to get


out of here,
just go,
pop off, get away from
memories of this
and all
that,
but staying has its
flavor too:
all those babes who
thought they were
hot numbers
now living in dirty
flats
while looking forward
to the next
episode on
some Soap Opera,
and all those guys,
those who really
thought
they were going to
make it,
grinning in the
Year Book with their
tight-skinned
mugs,
now they are
cops,
clerk typists,
operators of
sandwich stands,
horse grooms,
plops


in the dust.
it’s good to stay


around
to see what
happened to
all the
others-only


when you go to


the bathroom,
avoid the
mirror
and
don’t look
at
what you
flush
away.


finished












the ball comes up to the


plate and I can’t
see
it.


my batting average has dropped to


.231


small things constantly


irritate me
and I can’t sleep
nights.


“you’ll come back,


Harry,” my teammates
tell me.


then they grin and are


secretly
pleased.


I’ve been benched for a


22 year old
kid.


he looks good up there:


power, lots of line
drives.


“ever thought of coaching?”


the manager asks.


“no,” I tell him, “how about


you?”


when I get home my wife


asks, “you get in the lineup


tonight?”
“nope.”


“don’t worry, he’ll put you


in.”


“no, he won’t. I’m gonna


pinch hit the rest of the
season.”


I go into the bathroom and


look into the
mirror.


I’m no 22 year old


kid.


what gets me is that it


seemed to happen
overnight.


one night I was good.


the next night, it
seemed, I was
finished.


I come out of the bathroom


and my wife says,
“don’t worry, all you need


is a little
rest.”


“I been thinking about going


into coaching,” I tell
her.


“sure,” she says, “and after


that I’ll bet you’ll be a
good manager.”


“hell yes,” I say, “anything


on tv?”


zero










dark taste in mouth, my neck is stiff, I am looking for my sonic vibrator, the music on my radio is diseased, the winds of death seep through my slippers, and a terrible letter in the mail today from a pale non-soul who requests that he may come by to see me


in repayment, he says, for a ride he gave me home from a drunken Pasadena party 20 years ago.
also, one of the cats shit on the rug this
morning
and in the first race I bet this afternoon
the horse tossed the jock
coming out of the gate.


downstairs


I have a large photo of Hemingway
drunk before noon in Havana, he’s on the floor mouth open, his big belly trying to flop out of his shirt.


I feel like that photo and I’m not even drunk.


maybe
that’s the problem.


whatever the problem is, it’s there, and worse, it shouldn’t be


for I have been a lucky man, I shouldn’t even be here
after all I have done to myself
and after all they have done
to me
I ought to be kneeling to the gods and giving
thanks.


instead, I deride their kindness by being
impatient
with the world.


maybe a damned good night’s sleep will bring me back to a gentle sanity.


but at the moment, I look about this room and, like myself, it’s all in disarray: things fallen


out of place, cluttered, jumbled, lost, knocked over, and I can’t put it straight, don’t want to.


perhaps living through these petty days will get us ready for the dangerous ones.


eyeless through space












it’s no longer any good, sucker, they’ve


turned out the lights, they’ve
blocked the rear entrance
and
the front’s on fire;
nobody knows your name;
down at the opera they play
checkers;
the city fountains piss
blood;
the extremities are reamed
and
they’ve hung the best
barber;
the dim souls have ascended;
the cardboard souls smile;
the love of dung is unanimous;
it’s no longer any good, sucker, the
graves have emptied out onto the
living;
last is first,
lost is everything;
the giant dogs mourn through dandelion
dreams;
the panthers welcome cages;
the onion heart is frosted,
destiny is destitute,
the horns of reason are muted as
the laughter of fools blockades the air;
the champions are dead
and
the newly born are smitten;
the jetliners vomit the eyeless through
space;


it’s no longer any good, sucker, it’s been


getting to that
right along
and now
it’s here
and you can’t touch it smell it see it
because it’s nothing everywhere as


you look up or down or turn or sit or stand or sleep or run,
it’s no longer any good, sucker.
it’s no longer any good
sucker sucker sucker
and
if you don’t already know
I’m not surprised
and
if you do, sucker, good
luck
in the dark
going nowhere.


tag up and hold












not much chance in


Amsterdam;
cheese dislikes the
flea;
the center fielder
turns
runs back
in his stupid
uniform,
times it all
perfectly:
ball and man
arriving as
one
he
gloves it
precisely
in tune with the
universe;
not much chance in
east
Kansas City;
and
have you noticed
how
men stand
side by side
in urinals,
trained in the
act,
looking straight
ahead;
the center fielder
wings it


into the
cut-off
man
who eyes the
runners;
the sun plunges
down
as somewhere
an old
woman
opens a window
looks at a
geranium,
goes for a cup of
water;


not much chance in


New York City


or


in the look
of the eye
of
the man
who sits in a
chair
across from
you


he is


going
to ask you
certain
questions about
certain
things


especially
about


what to


do


without


much chance.


upon this time










fine then, thunderclaps at midnight, death in the plaza.
my shoes need shining.
my typewriter is silent.


I write this in pen


in an old yellow
notebook
while
leaning propped up against the wall
behind the
bed.


Hemingway said, “it won’t come


anymore.”
later—the gun
into the
mouth.


not writing is not good


but trying to write
when you can’t is
worse.


hey, I have excuses:


I have TB and the
antibiotics dull the
brain.


“you’ll write again,” people


assure me, “you’ll be
better than
ever.”


that’s nice to know.


but the typewriter is silent
and it looks at
me.


meanwhile, every two or three


weeks
I get a fan letter in the mail
telling me that
surely
I must be
the world’s greatest
writer.


but


the typewriter is silent
and looks at
me….


this is one of the


strangest times
of my
life.


I’ve got to do a


Lazarus
and I can’t even
shine
my shoes.


Downtown Billy










they used to call him


“Downtown” Billy.


“Downtown” had these


long arms
and he swung them
with
abandon
and with great
force.


when you fought


“Downtown” Billy
you never knew
where the punches
were coming
from: “They come
from Downtown…”


“Downtown” once rose


all the way
to #4 in his weight
class,
then he dropped out
of the first
ten.


then he fell to


fighting 6 rounders,
then 4.


the punches still
came from


Downtown
but you could
see them
coming.
then he was just a
sparring
partner.


last I heard


he left
town.


today I feel


like “Downtown” Billy,


sitting in this
blue garden chair
under the
walnut
tree,
watching the
neighbor boy
bounce a
basketball,
take some
fancy steps
forward,
then loop the
ball
through the
hoop
over the
garage
door.


I have just taken


my
pills.


8 count












from my bed


* watch
3 birds
on a telephone wire.


one flies


off.
then
another.


one is left,


then
it too
is gone.


my typewriter is


tombstone
still.


and I am


reduced to bird
watching.


just thought I’d


let you
know,
fucker.


ill










being very ill and very weak is a very strange thing.


when it takes all your strength to get from the bedroom to the bathroom and back, it seems like a joke but
you don’t laugh.


back in bed you consider death again and find the same thing: the closer you get to it the less forbidding it
becomes.


you have much time to examine the walls and outside
birds on a telephone wire take on much
importance.
and there’s the tv: men playing baseball
day after day.


no appetite.


food tastes like cardboard, it makes you
ill, more than
ill.


the good wife keeps insisting that you


eat.
“the doctor said…”


poor dear.


and the cats.
the cats jump up on the bed and look at me.


they stare, then jump
off.


what a world, you think: eat, work, fuck, die.
luckily I have a contagious disease: no
visitors.


the scale reads 155, down from


217.


I look like a man in a death camp.


I
am.


still, I’m lucky: I feast on solitude, I


will never miss the crowd.


I could read the great books but the great books don’t interest me.


I sit in bed and wait for the whole thing to go


one way or the
other.


just like everybody


else.


only one Cervantes












it’s no use, I’ve got to admit,


I am into my first real
writer’s block
after over


* decades of typing.


I have some excuses: I’ve had a long illness


and I’m nearing the age of 70.


and when you’re near
70 you always consider the possibility of


slippage.
but I am bucked-up by the fact that Cervantes


wrote his greatest work at the age of


80.
but how many Cervantes are there?


I’ve been spoiled with the


easy way I have created
things,
and now there’s this
miserable
stoppage.
and now


spiritually constipated I’ve
grown testy,
have screamed at my wife
twice this week,
once smashing a glass
into the sink.
bad form,
sick nerves,
bad
style.


I should accept this


writer’s block.
hell, I’m lucky I’m alive,
I’m lucky I don’t have
cancer.
I’m lucky in a hundred
different ways.
sometimes at night
in bed
at one or two a.m.
I will think about
how lucky I am
and it keeps me
awake.


now I’ve always written in a


selfish way, that is, to please


myself.
by writing things down I have


been better able to
live with them.


now, that’s


stopped.


I see other old men with canes
sitting at bus stop benches,


staring straight into the sun and


seeing nothing.
and I know there are other
old men
in hospitals and nursing
homes
sitting upright in their
beds
grunting over
bedpans.
death is nothing, brother,
it’s life that’s
hard.


writing has been my fountain


of youth,
my whore,
my love,
my gamble.


the gods have spoiled me.


yet look, I am still


lucky,
for writing about a
writer’s block
is better than not writing
at all.


that I have known the dead










that I have known the dead and now I’m


dying
as they spoon succotash and
noodles
into a skull
past
caring.


that I have known the dead and now I’m


dying
in a world long ago
gone


leaving this is


nothing.
loving it was
too.


that I have known the dead and now I’m


dying
fingers thin to the
bone,
I offer no
prayers.


that I have known the dead and now I’m


dying


dying


I have known the dead
here on earth


and elsewhere;


alone now,
alone then,
alone.


are you drinking?










washed-up, on shore, the old yellow notebook out again
I write from the bed
as I did last
year.


will see the doctor,


Monday.


“yes, doctor, weak legs, vertigo, head-aches


and my back
hurts.”


“are you drinking?” he will ask.


“are you getting your
exercise, your
vitamins?”


I think that I am just ill


with life, the same stale yet
fluctuating
factors.


even at the track


I watch the horses run by
and it seems
meaningless.


I leave early after buying tickets on the


remaining races.
“taking off?” asks the mutuel


clerk.


“yes, it’s boring,”


I tell him.
“if you think it’s boring


out there,” he tells me, “you oughta be


back here.”


so here I am


propped against my pillows
again


just an old guy


just an old writer
with a yellow
notebook.


something is


walking across the
floor
toward
me.


oh, it’s just


my cat


this


time.


“D”










the doctor is into collecting art


and the magazines in his waiting room


are Artsy
have thick covers, glistening pages,


and large color
photos.


the receptionist calls my name and


I’m led into a waiting room with
walls adorned with paintings
and a chart of the human
body.


the doctor enters: “how are you


doing?”


not well, I think, or I wouldn’t


be here.


“now,” he goes on, “I am surprised


by the biopsy, I didn’t expect
this…”


the doctor is a bald, well-scrubbed


pink fellow.


“I can almost always tell just by


looking; this time, I
missed…”


he paused.


“go on,” I say.


“all right, let’s say there are


4 types of cancer—A, B, C, D.
well, you’ve got
D.
and if I had cancer I’d rather
have your kind:
D.”


the doctor is in a tough business


but the pay is
good.


“well,” he says, “we’ll just burn it off,


o.k.?”


I stretch out on the table and he has an


instrument, I can feel the heat of it
searing through the air
but also
I hear a whirring sound
like a drill.


“it’ll be over in a


blink…”


the small growth is just inside of


the right nostril.
the instrument touches it
and
the room is filled with the smell
of burning flesh.


then he stops.
then he starts


again.


there is pain but it’s sharp and


centered.


he stops


again.
“now we are going to do it
once more to
clean it
up.”


he applies the instrument


again.
this time I feel the most
pain.


“there now…”


it’s finished, no bandage needed,


it’s
cauterized.


then I’m at the receptionist’s


desk, she makes out a bill, I
pay with my
Mastercard, am out the door,
down the stairway and there
in the parking lot
awaits
my faithful automobile.


It’s a day with a great deal of


afternoon left


I light a cigarette, start the
car and


get the hell
out of there


moving toward something


else.


in the bottom










in the bottom of the hour


lurks
the smoking claw
the red train
the letter home
the deep-fried blues.


in the bottom of the hour


lurks
the song you sang together
the mouse in the attic
the train window in the rain
the whiskey breath on grandfather
the coolness of the jail trustee.


in the bottom of the hour


lurks
the famous gone quite stupid
churches with peeling white paint
lovers who chose hyenas
schoolgirls giggling at atrophy
the suicide oceans of night.


in the bottom of the hour


lurks
button eyes in a cardboard face
dead library books squeezed upright.
in the bottom of the hour
lurks
the octopus


Gloria gone mad while shaving her armpits the gang wars
no toilet paper at all in a train station restroom a flat tire halfway to Vegas. in the bottom of the hour
lurks


the dream of the barmaid as the perfect girl the first and only home run


the father sitting in the bathroom with the door open the brave and quick death
the gang rape in the Fun House.


in the bottom of the hour


lurks
the wasp in the spider web
the plumbers moving to Malibu


the death of the mother like a bell that never rang the absence of wise old men.


in the bottom of the hour


lurks
Mozart


fast food joints where the price of a bad meal exceeds the hourly wage angry women and deluded men and faded children the housecat

lurks
the tree that cries in the night
the place that nobody found


being so young you thought you could change it being middle-aged and thinking you could survive it being old and thinking you could hide from it.


in the bottom of the hour


lurks
2:30 a.m.
and the next to last line
and then the last.


the creative act












for the broken egg on the floor


for the 5th of July
for the fish in the tank
for the old man in room 9
for the cat on the fence


for yourself


not for fame


not for money


you’ve got to keep chopping


as you get older


the glamour recedes


it’s easier when you’re young


anybody can rise to the


heights now and then


the buzzword is


consistency


anything that keeps it


going


this life dancing in front of


Mrs. Death.


a suborder of naked buds












the uselessness of the word is


evident.
I would like to make
this
piece of paper
shriek and dance and
laugh
but
the keys just
strike it harmlessly
and
we settle
for just a fraction of
the whole.


this incompleteness is all


we have:
we write the same things
over and over
again.
we are fools,
driven.


the uselessness of the word is


evident.


writers can only pretend to


succeed
some pretend well, others
not so


yet
none of us come


near
none of us even


close
sitting at these
machines


behooved to


live
out
our indecent
profession.


companion












I am not alone.


he’s here now.
sometimes I think he’s
gone
then he
flies back
in the morning or at
noon or in the
night.
a bird no one wants.
he’s mine.
my bird of pain.
he doesn’t sing.
that bird
swaying on the
bough.


you know and I know and thee know










that as the yellow shade rips


as the cat leaps wild-eyed
as the old bartender leans on the wood
as the hummingbird sleeps


you know and I know and thee know


as the tanks practice on false battlefields


as your tires work the freeway
as the midget drunk on cheap bourbon cries alone at night as the bulls are carefully bred for the matadors


as the grass watches you and the trees watch you as the sea holds creatures vast and true


you know and I know and thee know


the sadness and the glory of two slippers under a bed


the ballet of your heart dancing with your blood
young girls of love who will someday hate their mirrors


overtime in hell
lunch with sick salad


you know and I know and thee know


the end as we know it now


it seems such a lousy trick after the lousy agony but


you know and I know and thee know


the joy that sometimes comes along out of nowhere rising like a falcon moon across the impossibility


you know and I know and thee know


the cross-eyed craziness of total elation


we know that we finally have not been cheated you know and I know and thee know


as we look at our hands our feet our lives our way the sleeping hummingbird the murdered dead of armies
the sun that eats you as you face it


you know and I know and thee know


we will defeat death.


the sun slants in like a golden sword as the


odds grow shorter


show biz












I can’t have it


and you can’t have it
and we won’t
get it


so don’t bet on it


or even think about
it


just get out of bed


each morning


wash


shave
clothe
yourself
and go out into
it


because


outside of that
all that’s left is
suicide and
madness


so you just


can’t
expect too much


you can’t even


expect


so what you do


is
work from a modest


minimal
base
like when you
walk outside
be glad your car
might possibly
be there


and if it is—


that the tires
aren’t
flat


then you get


in
and if it
starts—you
start.


and


it’s the damndest
movie
you’ve ever
seen
because
you’re
in it—


low budget


and
* billion critics


and the longest
run


you ever hope


for
is


one


day.


darkness & ice










I am spooked by the bluebells and the silent harp while passing down Western Avenue and seeing the tombstones placed flat instead of upright upon the cemetery lawn: our decent modernity not wanting to upset us with Finalities while we pay 22% interest on our credit cards.


I follow the street on down


feeling wonderful that I do not appear to be lost.
we need our landmarks (like cemeteries), we need our liquor and our liabilities.


we need so many things we think we do not need.


strangely then, as I drive south, I begin thinking about


THE WORLD IS SQUARE, INC., an institution which meets and discusses the fact that: the world is square and the North Pole is at the CENTER of the SQUARE and holds everything from sliding over the edge and that the EDGE is really a WALL OF


DARKNESS AND ICE and that nothing or nobody can go through and that


when we THINK we are circling the globe we are only CIRCLING the SQUARE, finally arriving back where we began.


I wait at a signal, the light turns green and I move on thinking, well, maybe the planets we believe are round are illusions, and the moon and the sun, they are really square too.


well, you can’t rule anything out; I vote for round but I still realize that it wasn’t too long ago when EVERYBODY thought the answer was SQUARE.


I stop at another signal, wait, while being held from falling


over the EDGE OF DARKNESS AND ICE by the North Pole standing in the


CENTER of the SQUARE.


the light changes, I drive on, turn left, go a few blocks, turn right, go a block or so, turn left, go a block, turn right, then a left and I am at my driveway, turn in, drive slowly up to the garage


past the tangerine tree and the tangerines are round but the garage door is square and I am still spooked by the bluebells and the silent harp cut the engine
get out
stand up
still alive.


I move along the walk.


god, things are getting interesting again: they say there are
bottomless craters at the North Pole and deep in the earth live


Creatures from Outer Space
down there


in a marvelous, beautiful and peaceful Kingdom, I move toward the door, make ready to open it, not at all sure of what will be waiting on the other side—there is always this gnarling apprehension


generally but not always warranted, and as the North Pole holds me from falling off either the Curve or the Edge


I push open the wooden wall and enter, ready and not ready enough.


the big ride










all right,


some day you’ll see me in a plastic
helmet, long stockings,
double-lens goggles;
I’ll be tooling along on my 10-speed
bike on the promenade,
my face will be as intense
as a canteloupe and
in my knapsack
there could be a
bible, along with the
liverwurst sandwich and
the red red
apple.


off to one side the


sea will break and
break
and I will
pump along—a
well-lived
man,
lived a little, perhaps,
beyond his
sensibilities: too
much hair in the
ears, and face
badly shaven;
there, my lips
never again to
kiss a
virgin; I gulp in
the salty air


while being
unsure of the
time
but almost sure
of the
place.


all right, gliding


along
girding up for the
casket,
the sun like a
yellow glove to
grab me
I pass a group of
young ones
sitting in their
convertible.


“Jesus Christ,” I hear


a voice, “do you
know who that
was?”


was?


was?


why, you little


fart bells!
you bits of
bunny
droppings!


I kick it


into high, I
rise over a
hill
into a patch


of fog,
my legs
pump and
the
sea
breaks.


small cafe










you take a stool, unfold the paper, the waitress brings the java, you order bacon and


everybody in there is old and bent and poor, they are like the oldest people in the universe having breakfast


and it’s dark in there like the inside of a glove and some of the patrons speak to each other,


only their voices are broken and scratched and they speak


of simple things,
so simple


you think that they are joking but they hulk over their food, unsmiling… “Casmir died, he wore his green shoes…” “yeh.”


strange place there, no sadness, no rancor, an overhead


fan turns slowly, one of the blades bent a bit, it
clicks against the grate: “a-flick, a-flick, a-flick…”
nobody
notices.


my food arrives, it is hot and clean, but never coffee


like that (the worst), it is like drinking the water left in muddy footprints.


the old waitress is a dear, dressed in faded pink, she can hardly walk, she’s
sans everything.


“do you really love me?” she asks the young Mexican fry cook. “why?”
“because I can’t help it,” he says, running the spatula under a mass of hash browns, turning them.
I eat, peruse the newspaper, general idea I get is
that the world is not yet about to end but a
recession is to come creeping in wearing
faded tennis
shoes.


an old man looms in the doorway, he’s big in all the wrong ways and shuts out what little light there is.


“hey, anybody seen Vern?”


there is no answer, the old man


waits, he waits a good minute and a half, then he lets out a little fart.
I can hear it, everybody can. uh
huh.


he reaches up, scratches behind his left ear, then backs out of


the doorway and is
gone.


“that ratfucker,” somebody says, “zinched little Laura out of her dowry.”


the last bit of toast sogs down my throat, I wipe my mouth, leave


the tip, rise to pay the
bill.


the cash register is the old fashioned kind where the drawer jumps out when you hit the keys.


I was the last person to sit down to eat, I am the first to leave, the others still sit
fiddling with their food, fighting the coffee down


as I get to my car I start the engine, think, nice place, rather like an accidental love, maybe I’ll go back there once or


twice.


then I back out, swing around and enter the


real world
again.


washrag












leaving for the track in the morning


my wife asks me,
“did you wring out your washrag
properly?”


“yes,” I say.


“you never do,” she says,


“it’s important that you wring out
your washrag
properly.”


I get into my car,


start it,
back out the drive.


of course, she’s right, it is


important.
on the other hand
I don’t want to get into an
argument over
washrags.


she waves goodbye,


I wave back,
then I turn left,
go down the hill.


it is a fine sunny


day
and great matters loom
across the horizon


of
history.


Carthage in my rearview


mirror,
I blend into
Time.


sitting with the IBM










another still, hot summer night,


the small insects circle my wineglass, my winebottle.


I once again consider my death


as a Brahms symphony ends upon the
radio.


the horses didn’t run today (not


here) but there was gunfire, murder,
bombings in many parts of the
earth.
there is always a contest
of sorts
at hand.


and the years move slow and the years


move fast and the years move
past.


it seems not so long ago that


old Henry Miller was still
alive,
always finding new young girls to dust


his lampshades, pose for him, and make him nice little meals.
what a ladies’ man, he could never get
enough of them.


anyhow, my 5 cats dislike the heat, they


sit outside under the cool juniper bushes
listening to me
type.


sometimes they bring me presents:
birds or mice.


then we have a little misunderstanding.


and they back off
looking at me
and their eyes say: this guy’s nuts,
he doesn’t know that this is the way
it works.


another hot summer night as I sit here


and play at being a writer
again.
and the worst thing
of course
is that the words will never
truly break through for any of
us.


some nights I have taken the sheet


out of the typer and
held it over the cigarette
lighter, flicked
it and waited for the
result.


“Hank, are you burning things again?”


my wife will ask.


anyhow, there’s another composer on the radio now
and there is only so much he can do
with his notes.
I am proud for him and yet
sad for him too.


the radio is old and dusty


and through
the speaker


he talks to me.


it’s as if he were hiding in there


and I want to console him, say:
“I am sorry, poor fellow, but
creation has its
limits.”


another hot summer night


another sheet of paper in this machine,


more insects, more cigarettes in
this place, this time, hurrah hurrah, lost


in the grisly multitude of days
the speaker in the radio vibrates, trembles as the composer swells out at me, the son of a bitch is good
so brave despite his limitations
as the cats wait under the juniper


bushes and I pour more wine, more wine, more wine.


my buddy, the buddha










I must wash this buddha that sits on my desk— dust and grime all over him mostly on his chest and belly; ah,
we have endured many long nights together; we have


endured trivia and horror; at unseemly times we
have laughed
cleanly—now
the least he deserves is a good
going over
with a wet rag;
truly terrible have been
some long nights but
the buddha has been good, quiet
company; he never quite looks at me but
he seems to be forever laughing—he’s
laughing at this muck of
existence: there’s nothing to be done.


“why clean me?” he now asks, “I will only dirty again.”


“I am only pretending at some dumb sanity,” I answer.


“drink your wine,” he responds, “that’s what you’re good at.”
“and,” I ask, “what are you good
at?”


he returns: “I am good at almost watching you.”


then he becomes silent.


he holds a circle of beads with a
tassel.


how did he get in


here?


the interviewers












the interviewers come around


and there is nothing that you can
really
tell them.


it’s


embarrassing
and the easiest way out
is to get yourself
and them
drunk.


sometimes there is also a


camera man and a sound
man
and so it becomes a
party with
many bottles
needed.


I don’t think they want to


hear the literary crap
either.


it seems to work out all


right:
I get letters
later:


“I really had a good


time…”
or: “it was the best time


I ever had.”


how strange, when all I


remember
of any particular night is


saying goodbye at the


door
with: “don’t leave


anything behind so you


have to
come back.”


freaky time










the lady down at the end of the bar keeps looking at me, I put my head down, I look away, I light
a cigarette, glance again: she’s still staring at me, she’s charmingly dressed and she, herself, well, you might say she’s beautiful.
her eyes meld with mine; I am
elated and nervous, then
she gets up, goes to the ladies’ room:
such a behind!
such grace!
what a gazelle!


I glance at my face in the bar mirror, look away.


she’s back; then the barkeep comes down: “a drink from the lady at the end of the bar.”


I nod thanks to her, lift my drink, smile, have a hit.


she is looking again, what a strange and pleasurable experience.


I look forward, examine the backs of my hands—not bad hands as far as hands go.


then, at once, it occurs to me:


she has mistaken me for somebody
else.
I leave my stool and slowly walk to the exit,


and out into the night; I walk half a block down the


boulevard, feel the need for a smoke, slip the
pack of cigarettes out of my coat pocket, look


curiously at the brand name (I did not purchase


these): DEATH, it
says.


I curse, hurl the pack into the street, move toward the next bar: knew it all along: she was a whore.


the aliens












you may not believe it


but there are people
who go through life with
very little
friction or
distress.
they dress well, eat
well, sleep well.
they are contented with
their family
life.
they have moments of
grief
but all in all
they are undisturbed
and often feel
very good.
and when they die
it is an easy
death, usually in their
sleep.


you may not believe


it
but such people do
exist.


but I am not one of


them.
oh no, I am not one
of them,
I am not even near
to being


one of
them


but they are


there


and I am


here.


shock treatment












the fight I saw,


after the tv cameras were
shut off,
a fighter in green
trunks and
a fighter in blue,
only 50 to 75
absolutely silent
people
remaining,
you heard each
blow
land
crushingly
amid
sweat, saliva
blood,
gasps of
agony,
drinks no longer
served,
all the lights
on,
thousands of
empty
seats,
the bell rang
to end the
round,
it clanged
right through
you
as the boxers
went back


sat on their


stools
and were


swabbed by


listless
cornermen.


we were all


in hell
all of us
and I
got up
and left
that time.


between races












I know that I’m not supposed to bother


you, he said.


you’ve got that right, I


answered.


but, he went on, I want to tell you


that I was up all night
reading your
latest book.
I’ve read all your
books.
I work in the
post office.


oh, I said.


and I want to interview you for


our newspaper.


no, I said, no


interview.


why? he asked.


I’m tired of interviews, they have


nothing to do with
anything.


listen, he went on, I’ll make it


easy for you, I’ll come to your
house or I’ll buy you dinner at


Musso’s.


no, thank you, I said.


look, the interview isn’t really for


our paper, it’s for
me, I’m a writer and I want to get


out of the post
office.


listen, I said, just pull up a chair


and sit down at your
typewriter.


no interview? he asked.


no, I answered.


he walked


off.


they were coming out on the track


for the next race.


talking to the young man had


made me feel
bad.


they thought that writing had


something to do with
the politics of the
thing.


they were simply not


crazy enough
in the head
to sit down to a
typer


and let the words bang


out.


they didn’t want to


write
they wanted to
succeed at
writing.


I got up to make


my bet.


no use letting a little


conversation
ruin your
day.


splashing












dumb,


Jesus Christ,
some people are so dumb
you can hear them
splashing around
in their dumbness
as their eyes
look out of their
heads.
they have
most of their
parts: hands, feet,
ears, legs, elbows,
intestines, fingernails,
noses and so
forth
but
there’s nothing
there
yet
they are able to
speak,
form sentences—
but what
comes out
of their mouths
are the stalest
concepts, the most
warped beliefs,
they are the repository
of all the obvious
stupidities
they have
stuffed


themselves
with
and it hurts me
to
look at them
to
listen to them,
I want to
run and hide
I want to
escape their engulfing


nullity


there is no


horror movie
worse,
no murder
as
unsolved


but


the world
goes on
and
they
go on


dumbly


slamming
my guts to
pieces.


darkling










some nights you don’t sleep.


of course
having 3 or 4 cats on the bed
doesn’t help.
my wife likes to carry them up
from downstairs
but
it’s not always the cats, it’s
hardly anything,
say,
re-working horse systems in my
brain, or it’s a cold moon, an
itchy back, the
thought of death out
there
beyond the venetian blinds
or
I’ll think nice things about my
wife, she looks so small there
under the blanket, a little
lump, that’s all
(death, you take me first, please,
this lady needs a gentle space of
peace
without me).


then a boat horn blows from the


harbor.
I pull my head up, stretching
my thick neck, I see the
clock:
3:36 a.m.
that always does it: looking at


the clock.
by 3:45 a.m. I am asleep, just


like the cats, just like my
wife,


the venetian blinds closing us


all in.


Celine with cane and basket












tonight I am nothing


I have lost touch with the walls
I have seen too many heads, hands, feet,
heard too many voices,
I am weary with the continuation,
the music is old music,
there is no stirring in the air.


on my wall is a photo of


Celine,
he has a cane,
carries a basket,
wears a coat too heavy,
a long strand of hair falls across his face, he has been stunned by life, the dogs have had at him,
it got to be too much
much too much.


he walks through a small forest,


this doctor,
this typer of words,
all he wants to do is die,
that’s all he wants,
and his photo is on the wall
and he is dead.


this year


1988
all these months
have had
a terribleness to them
that I have never felt


before.


I light a cigarette and


wait.


no more, no less












editor, critic, bigot, wit:


what do you expect of me
now that my youth has
flown and even my middle
age is
gone?


I expect what I’ve always


expected:
the hard-driven line
and a bit of help
from the
gods.


as the walls get closer


there should be more to
say
instead of
less.


each day is still a


hammer,
a flower.


editor, critic, bigot, wit:


the grave has no
mirror


and I am still this


machine
this paper
and all the
etceteras.


the lost and the desperate












it was nice to be a boy in a dark movie house, one entered the dream so much more easily then.
I liked the French Foreign Legion movies best and there were many of them then.


I loved the forts and the sand and the


lost and desperate men.
these men were brave and they had beautiful eyes.


I never saw men like that


in my neighborhood.
the neighborhood men were hunched and miserable and angry and cowardly.


I was going to join the French Foreign Legion.


I sat in the dark movie houses and I was


one of them.


we had been fighting for days without food


and with very little
water.


casualties had been horrendous.


our fort was surrounded, we were down to a last few.
we propped up our dead comrades with


their rifles pointed toward the
desert


to make the Arabs think that they had not killed many of us
otherwise we would have been
overwhelmed.


we ran from dead man to dead man


firing their rifles.
our sergeant was wounded
3 or 4 times but
he still commanded
screaming his orders.


then more of us died gallantly, then


we were down to the last two
(one of them the sergeant) but we
fought on, then we were out of
ammunition, the Arabs scaled the walls
on ladders and we knocked them back
with our rifle butts but more and more of
them were clambering over the walls, there
were too many
of them we were


finished, no chance, then there was the sound of a


BUGLE!
reinforcements were arriving!


fresh and rested upon the backs of thunderous horses!
they charged en masse over the sand,
hundreds of them
dressed in bright and blazing uniforms.
the Arabs scattered down the walls
running for their horses and their
lives
but most of them were
doomed.


then the sergeant, knowing victory, was dying in my arms.
“Chinaski,” he said to me, “the fort is
ours!”


he gave a small smile, his head fell back and he was gone.
then I was home again
I was back in my room.
a hunched, miserable and angry man
walked into the room and said,
“get out there now and mow the lawn.
I see a hair of grass sticking up!”


out there in the yard


I pushed the mower over the same grass
once more
back and forth
back and forth
wondering why all the brave men with
beautiful eyes were so far away,
wondering if they’d still be there
when I arrived.


the bully










actually, I do think that


my father was
insane,
the way he drove his
car,
honking,
cursing at people;
the way he got into
violent arguments
in public places
over the most
trivial incidents;
the way he beat
his only child
almost daily
upon the slightest
provocation.


of course, bullies


sometimes meet their
masters.


I remember once


entering the house
and my mother
told me,
“your father was
in a terrible
fight.”


I looked for him,


found him sitting
on the toilet


with the bathroom
door
open.


his face was a mass of


bruises, welts,
puffed and black
eyes.


he even had a broken


arm
in a cast.


I was 13 years old.


I stood looking
at him.
I looked for
some time.


then he screamed,


“what the hell you
staring at!
what’s your
problem?”


I looked at him


some more,
then walked
off.


it was to be


3 years later
that
I would knock him
on his
ass, no problem
with that
at
all.


downers












some people


grind away
making their
unhappiness
the ultimate
factor
of their
existence
until
finally
they are
just
automatically
unhappy,
their
suspicious
upset
snarling
selves
grinding


on


and
at
and
for
and
through


their only


relief
being


to meet


another


unhappy


person
or
to
create
one.


get close enough and you can’t see












at this time


I know a couple of men
who seem to be in
love
while their ladies are treating
them
off-handedly or
worse.


these men are consumed by


their
ill-fate, can’t
climb out of their
fix.


I too


have been in that
way,
only I was
worse
off:
I was charmed and
ensnared by
caseic beldames,
slimey slatterns,
inchoate prostitutes,
hypacodont
mesdames—
all the hustling
shrews of the
universe
found me,
and I


found them
wise
witty and
beautiful
then.


it was only after


some luck of
distance and time
that I was able to
realize
that
these ladies


were even less than


less.


so


now
when these men
tell me their sad
stories
there is nothing I can


say
because to me
their women look
like
hypacodont
beldames,
inchoate
slatterns,
caseic
mesdames
and
slimey
prostitutes,
not to mention
piss-biting
shrews


and they


most
probably
are.


true is true


enough,
yet
at small
tiny and
rare
moments


* wonder what


* seemed like


to my ladies?


the beggars












the poor


in the grandstand section
playing the
daily doubles
the exactas
the pick-6’s
the pick-9’s


they have horrible


jobs
or
no jobs


they come in


beaten
to take another
beating.


scuffed shoes


shirts with buttons
missing,
faded and wrinkled
clothing—
muted eyes,
they are the
unwashed
the
unwanted


the beggars of the


grandstand
and as race after race


unfolds
they are routinely
sucked of
money and
hope
then
the last race is
over


and for a few


there’s the
liquor
store


a bit to drink


and a
lottery
ticket.


for the


others:
nothing.


beggars of the


grandstand.


the State is going


to
make it.


the track is going


to
make
it


thanks to the
Days of the Living


Dead.


well,


the horses are
beautiful
anyhow.


the old horseplayer












he wears the same pants


the same coat
the same shoes
day after day.


his shirttail hangs out.


his shoes are unlaced.
his hair is white and
uncombed.
he is balding.


he walks slowly to make his


bets, then
walks slowly back to his
seat.


he watches each race


without emotion.


he is hooked on nothing but


an impossibility.


he is so tired.


the old horseplayer.


the skies, the mountains,


music, nothing matters to
him.


he’s hooked on an
impossibility.


post time












some of the old rich still make it to


Santa Anita Turf Club parking.
and the old rich still buy Cadillacs—


and he can barely drive the Caddy—


and the valet helps them both
out.
he’s fat and squat, very white, with
merry blue eyes and she’s taller,
dignified but dumb, and her back is


bent.
expensively clothed


they both move toward the Turf Club


entrance
where they are swallowed forever
as the horn sounds to post


and the number one horse steps out


on the track
more beautiful than all the people
more beautiful than all the world
and it
begins.


off and on










at times I still consider coughing it up: gas pipe, 19th floor window, 3 fifths of whiskey in 4 hours or slamming at 85 mph into a slab of
concrete.


my first thought of suicide came at age 13 and it has


been with me ever since
through all the botched failures:
sometimes just rather playing at it, little minor
rehearsals;
other times
really trying like hell to
kill myself.


yet, now it’s never totally intense, it’s more like considering whether to go to a movie or not or whether to buy a new pair of
shoes.
actually, years go by and the suicidal thoughts
almost completely
abate.
then
suddenly
they return, like:
look here, baby, let’s give it another
shot.


and when it returns it’s fairly


compelling
but not so much in the mind (as in the old


days) but strangely, suicide waits in old little places, on the back of your neck or
at a spot just under the chin


or along the arms like the sleeves of a
sweater…
it used to hit the gut, now it’s almost like
catching a
rash.


I will be driving along in my car with the radio on and it will leap at me and I will smile at it
remembering the old days
when those I knew thought that
my daring crazy acts stemmed from
bravery…


I will drive for several hours


up and down strange streets in
strange neighborhoods
at times
slowing down carefully
where children are playing in the
road.


I will park


go into cafes
drink coffee
read newspapers.
I will hear voices speaking of
ridiculous and dull
things.


I will be back in the car


driving along
and at once
everything will lift:
we all live in the same world:
I will have to pay my gas bill, get a
set of new reading glasses, I will need a
new tire


left rear
and I think I’ve been using my neighbor’s garbage can.
it is fine to be normal again and
as I pull into the driveway
a large white moon smiles at me
through the windshield of
evening.


I brake, get out, close the car


door, centuries of sadness, gladness and


equilibrium will walk with me up to the door


as I put in the key
unlock it
walk into the place
once again having escaped the
inescapable, I will move toward the
kitchen cabinet for the
bottle
to
celebrate
that
or
whatever there is,
isn’t,
will be,
won’t
be—
like right
now.


balloons












today they shot a guy who was


selling balloons at the
intersection.


they parked their cars at the


curbing
and called him
over.


he came


over.


they argued with him about


the price of a
balloon, they wanted him
to come down in
price.


he said he couldn’t.


one of them started calling


him names.


the other took out a gun


and shot him in the
head.
twice.


he fell


right there
in the street.


they took his balloons,


said, “now we can
party,” and then they
drove off


there are also other guys


at that intersection, they


sell oranges
mostly.


they left then


and they weren’t at the


intersection the next day


or the next or
the next.


nobody was.


recognized












I was at the airport


standing at the arrival section
with my wife
waiting for her sister’s
flight in
when a young man walked up:
“aren’t you Henry Chinaski?”
“well, yes…”
“oh, I thought so!”
there was a pause.
then
he continued: “you don’t
know what this
means to me!
I can’t believe it!
I’ve read all your books!”
“thank you,” I said, “I have to be
thankful for my
readers.”
he gave me his name and we
shook hands.
“this is my wife,” I started…
“Sarah!” he said,
“I know her
from your books!”
another pause.
then:
“I get all your books from Red
down at Baroque…
I still can’t believe it’s
you!”
“it is,” laughed my wife,
“it’s him!”
“well,” he said, “I’ll leave you


alone now!”
“tell Red I said ‘hello.’”
then the young man
moved off.
“he was all right,” I said,
“I usually can’t stand
them.”


“like you say, you have to


be thankful for your
readers.”


“damned right…”


then her sister’s plane tooled


up and we moved with the others


to greet those we knew and those


who knew
us.


them and us












they were all out on the front porch


talking:
Hemingway, Faulkner, T. S. Eliot,


Ezra Pound, Hamsun, Wally Stevens,


e. e. cummings and a few others.


“listen,” said my mother, “can’t you


ask them to stop talking?”


“no,” I said.


“they are talking garbage,” said my


father, “they ought to get
jobs.”


“they have jobs,” I


said.


“like hell,” said my


father.


“exactly,” I


said.


just then Faulkner came


staggering in.
he found the whiskey in the
cupboard and went outside with
it.


“a terrible person,”
said my mother.


then she got up and peeked out


on the porch.
“they’ve got a woman with them,”


she said, “only she looks like a
man.”


“that’s Gertrude,” I


said.


“there’s another guy flexing his


muscles,” she said, “he claims he


can whip any three of
them.”


“that’s Ernie,” I said.


“and he,” my father pointed to me,


“wants to be like them!”


“is that true?” my mother asked.


“not like them,” I said, “but of


them.”


“you get a god-damned job,”


said my father.


“shut up,” I said.


“what?”


“I said, ‘shut up,’ I am listening to


these men.”


my father looked at his wife:
“this is no son of


mine!”


“I hope not,” I said.


Faulkner came staggering into the room


again.
“where’s the telephone?” he
asked.


“what the hell for?” my father


asked.


“Ernie’s just blown his brains


out,” he said.


“you see what happens to men like


that?” screamed my father.


I got up


slowly
and helped Bill find
the
telephone.


luck was not a lady












being half-young I sat about the bars


in it up to the ears
thinking something might happen to
me, I mean, I tried the ladies:
“hey, baby, listen, the golden coast
weeps for your beauty…”
or some such.


their heads never turned, they looked


ahead, straight ahead,
bored.


“hey, baby, listen, I am a


genius, ha ha ha…”


silent before the bar mirror, these


magic creatures, these secret sirens,
big-legged, bursting out of their
dresses, wearing dagger
heels, earrings, strawberry mouths,
just sitting there, sitting there,
sitting there.


one of them told me, “you bore


me.”


“no, baby, you got it


backwards…”


“oh, shut up.”
then in would walk some dandy, some fellow neat in a suit, pencil mustache, bow tie; he would be slim, light, delicate
and so knowing
and the ladies would call his
name: “oh, Murray, Murray!”
or some such.


“hi, girls!”


I knew I could deck one of those


fuckers but that hardly mattered in the
scheme of things,
the ladies just gathered around Murray
(or some such) and I just kept ordering
drinks,
sharing the juke music with them
and listening to the laughter from
the outside.


I wondered what wonderful things I was missing, the secret of the magic, something that only they knew, and I felt myself again the idiot in the schoolyard, sometimes a man never got out of there—he was marked, it could be told at a glance


and so


I was shut out,
“I am the lost face of
Janus,” I might say at some
momentary silence.
of course, to be
ignored.


they’d pile out


to cars parked in back
smoking


laughing
finally to drive off
to some consummate
victory
leaving me
to keep on drinking
just me
sitting there
then the face of the
bartender near
mine:


“LAST CALL!”


his meaty indifferent face


cheap in the cheap
light
to have my last drink


go out to my ten year old car


at the curb
get in
to drive ever so carefully
to my rented
room


remembering the schoolyard


again,
recess time,
being chosen next to last
on the baseball team,
the same sun shining on me


as on them,
now it was night,
most people of the world
together.
my cigarette dangling,
I heard the sound of the
engine.


the editor










he sat in the kitchen at the breakfastnook table reading the manuscripts writing a short rejection on each replacing the paperclip then sliding the pages back into the brown


manila envelopes.


he’d been reading for an hour and thirty-five minutes and hadn’t found a single poem


well he’d have to do the usual thing


for the next issue: write the poems himself and make up names for the authors.


where was the talent?


for the last 3 decades the poets had


flattened
out it was like reading stuff
from a house of
subnormals.


but


he’d save Rabowski
for last


Rabowski had sent 8 or ten poems in a batch but always there were one or two good ones.


he sighed and pulled out the Rabowski


poems.


he slowly read them he finished


he got up went to the refrigerator


got out
a can of beer cracked it sat back
down


he read the poems all over again they were all bad even Rabowski had crapped out.


the editor got out a printed rejection slip


wrote “you must have had a bad
week.”
then he slipped the poems back into the
manila envelope sealed it tossed it
on top of the pile for mailing


then he took the beer sat down next to his wife on the couch


she was watching Johnny Carson


he watched


Carson was bad Carson knew he was bad but he couldn’t do anything about it.






the editor got up with his can of beer and began walking up the stairway.






“where are you going?” his wife


asked.


“to bed to sleep.”


“but it’s early.”


“god damn it I know that!”


“well you needn’t act that way


about it!”
he walked into the bedroom flicked on
the wall switch
there was a small bright flash and then
the overhead light burned
out.


he sat on the edge of the bed and finished his


beer in the
dark.


duck and forget it










today at the track


I was standing alone
looking down
when I saw these
two shoes
moving directly
toward
me


at once


I started into motion
toward my right
but he still caught part of
me:


“making any money


today?”


“yeah,” I answered and


was gone.


not too many years ago


I would have stood
there
while this slipped
soul
unloaded his
inanities on
me
pissing over my day
and my feelings
as he made me pay
for where he allowed


himself to be
in his mind
and in his
life.
no longer.


yet I am my brother’s


keeper.


I keep him


away.


snapshots at the track












I go to the men’s crapper


for a bowel
movement,
get up to flush.
what the hell.
something blood-dark
falls upon the
seat.
I’m 70, I
drink.
have been on my deathbed
twice.
I reach down for what has
fallen…
it’s a small burnt
potato chip
from my
lunch.
not yet…
damn thing fell from my
shirt…


I finish my toiletry,


go out and watch the
race.
my horse runs
second
chasing a 25-to-one
shot
to the
wire.
I don’t mind.


then I see this fellow


rushing toward me,
he always needs a


shave, his glasses seem


about to fall off
his face,
he knows me
and maybe I know
him.


“hey, Hank, Hank!”


we shake hands like two


lost souls.
“always good to see you,”


he says, “it refreshes
me, I know you lead a
hard life
just like I
do.”


“sure, kid, how you


doing?”


he tells me that he is


a big winner
then
rushes off.
the big board
overhead
flashes the first odds
on the next
race.


I check my program


decide to leave the
clubhouse,


try my luck in the
grandstand,


that’s where a hard-living


player belongs
anyhow,
right?


right.


x-idol










I never watch tv so I don’t know


but I’m told he was the leading man in a


long-running
series.
he does movie bits
now
I see him at the track almost every


day (“I used to have women coming out of my ass,” he once informed me).


and people still remember him, call him by name and my wife often asks me, “did you see him today?”


“oh yes, he’s a gambling son of a bitch.”


the track is where you go when the other action drops away.


he still looks like a celebrity, the way


he walks and talks and
I never meet him without feeling
good.


the toteboard flashes.


the sky shakes.


the mountains call us home.


heat wave










another one.


this night the people sit drunk or drugged or some of them


sit in front of their tv sets
slapped silly.
some few have air-conditioning.


the neighborhood dogs and cats flop about waiting for a better time.


and I remember the cars along the freeway today some of them stalled in the fast lane, hoods up.


there are more murders in the heat


more domestic arguments.


Los Angeles has been burning for


weeks.


even the desperately lonely have not phoned


and that alone
makes all this almost
worthwhile:


those little mewling voices cooked into


silence
as I listen to the music of a long dead man
written in the 19th
century.


we ain’t got no money, honey, but we got rain












call it the greenhouse effect or whatever


but it just doesn’t rain like it
used to.


I particularly remember the rains of the


depression era.
there wasn’t any money but there was


plenty of rain.


it wouldn’t rain for just a night or


a day,
it would RAIN for 7 days and 7
nights


and in Los Angeles the storm drains


weren’t built to carry off that much
water


and the rain came down THICK and


MEAN and
STEADY
and you HEARD it banging against
the roofs and into the ground
waterfalls of it came down
from the roofs
and often there was HAIL
big ROCKS OF ICE
bombing
exploding
smashing into things
and the rain
just wouldn’t
STOP
and all the roofs leaked—
dishpans,


cooking pots
were placed all about;
they dripped loudly
and had to be emptied
again and
again


the rain came up over the street curbings, across the lawns, climbed the steps and entered the houses.
there were mops and bathroom towels, and the rain often came up through the toilets: bubbling, brown, crazy, whirling, and the old cars stood in the streets, cars that had problems starting on a sunny day,


and the jobless men stood
looking out the windows
at the old machines dying
like living things
out there.


the jobless men,


failures in a failing time
were imprisoned in their houses with their


wives and children
and their
pets.
the pets refused to go out
and left their waste in
strange places.


the jobless men went mad


confined with
their once beautiful wives.
there were terrible arguments
as notices of foreclosure
fell into the mailbox.


rain and hail, cans of beans,


bread without butter; fried
eggs, boiled eggs, poached


eggs; peanut butter
sandwiches, and an invisible


chicken
in every pot.


my father, never a good man


at best, beat my mother
when it rained
as I threw myself
between them,
the legs, the knees, the
screams
until they
separated.


“I’ll kill you,” I screamed


at him. “You hit her again
and I’ll kill you!”


“Get that son-of-a-bitching


kid out of here!”


“no, Henry, you stay with


your mother!”


all the households were under


siege but I believe that ours


held more terror than the
average.


and at night


as we attempted to sleep
the rains still came down
and it was in bed
in the dark


watching the moon against


the scarred window
so bravely
holding out
most of the rain,
I thought of Noah and the


Ark
and I thought, it has come


again.
we all thought
that.


and then, at once, it would


stop.
and it always seemed to
stop
around 5 or 6 a.m.,
peaceful then,
but not an exact silence


because things continued to


drip
drip
drip


and there was no smog then


and by 8 a.m.
there was a
blazing yellow sunlight,
Van Gogh yellow—
crazy, blinding!
and then
the roof drains
relieved of the rush of
water
began to expand in
the warmth:
PANG! PANG! PANG!


and everybody got up


and looked outside
and there were all the lawns


still soaked
greener than green will ever


be
and there were the birds
on the lawn
CHIRPING like mad,
they hadn’t eaten decently
for 7 days and 7 nights
and they were weary of
berries
and
they waited as the worms
rose to the top,
half-drowned worms.
the birds plucked them
up
and gobbled them
down; there were
blackbirds and sparrows.
the blackbirds tried to
drive the sparrows off
but the sparrows,
maddened with hunger,
smaller and quicker,
got their
due.


the men stood on their porches


smoking cigarettes,
now knowing
they’d have to go out
there
to look for that job
that probably wasn’t
there, to start that car


that probably wouldn’t
start.


and the once beautiful


wives
stood in their bathrooms
combing their hair,
applying makeup,
trying to put their world back


together again,
trying to forget that
awful sadness that
gripped them,
wondering what they could


fix for
breakfast.


and on the radio


we were told that
school was now
open.
and
soon
there I was
on the way to school,
massive puddles in the
street,
the sun like a new
world,
my parents back in that
house,
I arrived at my classroom
on time.


Mrs. Sorenson greeted us


with, “we won’t have our
usual recess, the grounds
are too wet.”


“AW!” most of the boys


went.


“but we are going to do


something special at
recess,” she went on,
“and it will be
fun!”


well, we all wondered


what that would
be
and the two hour wait
seemed a long time
as Mrs. Sorenson
went about
teaching her
lessons.


I looked at the little


girls, they all looked so


pretty and clean and
alert,
they sat still and
straight
and their hair was
beautiful
in the California
sunshine.


then the recess bell rang


and we all waited for the


fun.


then Mrs. Sorenson told


us:
“now, what we are going to


do is we are going to tell
each other what we did
during the rainstorm!
we’ll begin in the front
row and go right around!
now, Michael, you’re
first!…”


well, we all began to tell


our stories, Michael began


and it went on and on,
and soon we realized that


we were all lying, not
exactly lying but mostly


lying and some of the boys


began to snicker and some


of the girls began to give


them dirty looks and
Mrs. Sorenson said,
“all right, I demand a
modicum of silence
here!
I am interested in what
you did
during the rainstorm
even if you
aren’t!”


so we had to tell our


stories and they were
stories.


one girl said that


when the rainbow first
came
she saw God’s face
at the end of it.
only she didn’t say


which end.


one boy said he stuck


his fishing pole
out the window
and caught a little
fish
and fed it to his
cat.


almost everybody told


a lie.
the truth was just
too awful and
embarrassing to
tell.
then the bell rang
and recess was
over.


“thank you,” said Mrs.


Sorenson, “that was very


nice
and tomorrow the grounds


will be dry
and we will put them
to use
again.”


most of the boys


cheered
and the little girls
sat very straight and
still,
looking so pretty and
clean and
alert,
their hair beautiful


in a sunshine that


the world might
never see
again.


crime and punishment












Mr. Sanderson was the principal of


my high school
and it seemed that much
of the time
I was in Mr. Sanderson’s
office
and I had no idea
why.


the teacher would send me down


with a sealed
envelope.
Mr. Sanderson would open the
envelope
read the enclosure
and then look at
me.


“well, here we are


again!
we just can’t behave ourselves,
can
we?”


he always said the same


thing.
I rather liked the idea of
being bad
but I had no idea
that I
was.
I didn’t protest


because
I thought that
the teachers were
stupid
and that
Mr. Sanderson was
stupid
so
there was nobody
to protest
to.
certainly not
my parents
who were more stupid
than
any of
them.


“all right,” Mr. Sanderson would


say, “go into the phone booth,


close the door
and don’t come out until I
tell you
to.”


it was one of those


glassed in phone booths with a


little seat.
all the times I sat there
the phone never
rang.
and it was stuffy
in there.
all you could do in there
was think
and I didn’t want to
think.
Mr. Sanderson knew that.


there were magazines in
there
but they were all dull,
fancy ladies
magazines
but I read them
anyhow
and that really made me
feel bad
which was what Mr.
Sanderson wanted.


finally


after one or two hours
he would bang on the
door with his big
fist and yell, “ALL RIGHT,
YOU CAN COME OUT OF THERE


NOW
AND I DON’T EVER WANT TO
SEE YOU IN HERE AGAIN!”


but


I’d be back
many times


never knowing


why.


finally


like somebody doing
time
I got out of that
high school
and it was a couple
of years later
that I read
in the newspaper


that Mr. Sanderson
had been
prosecuted
fined and
jailed
for
embezzlement of
school
funds.


while I had been


in that phone booth
diddling with
myself
that son of a
bitch
had been making
his
moves.


I felt like


going down to
the jail
and dumping a
bunch of
Ladies’ Home Journal


on him
but of course
* didn’t.


* felt good enough about it


just the way it was.


the soldier, his wife and the bum












I was a bum in San Francisco but once managed


to go to a symphony concert along with the well-dressed people


and the music was good but something about the audience was not
and something about the orchestra
and the conductor was
not,
although the building was fine and the
acoustics perfect
I preferred to listen to the music alone
on my radio
and afterwards I did go back to my room and I turned on the radio but
then there was a pounding on the wall:
“SHUT THAT GOD-DAMNED THING OFF!”


there was a soldier in the next room


living with his wife
and he would soon be going over there to protect me from Hitler so
I snapped the radio off and then heard his
wife say, “you shouldn’t have done that.”
and the soldier said, “FUCK THAT GUY!”
which I thought was a very nice thing for him
to tell his wife to do.
of course,
she never did.


anyhow, I never went to another live concert and that night I listened to the radio very quietly, my ear pressed to the
speaker.


war has its price and peace never lasts and millions of young men everywhere would die and as I listened to the classical music I heard them making love, desperately and mournfully, through Shostakovich, Brahms, Mozart, through crescendo and climax, and through the shared
wall of our darkness.


Bonaparte’s Retreat










Fred, they called him.


he always sat at the end of the
bar
near the doorway
and he was always there
from opening to
closing.
he was there more than
I was,
which is saying
something.


he never talked to


anybody.
he just sat there
drinking his glasses of
draft beer.
he looked straight ahead
right across the bar
but he never looked at
anybody.


and there’s one other


thing.


he got up


now and then
and went to the
jukebox
and he always played the
same record:
Bonaparte’s Retreat.


he played that song


all day and all night
long.
it was his song,
all right.


he never got tired


of it.


and when his draft beers


really got to him
he’d get up and play
Bonaparte’s Retreat
6 or 7 times
running.


nobody knew who he was or


how he made
it,
only that he lived in a
hotel room
across the street


and was the first customer


in the bar
each day
as it
opened.


I protested to Clyde


the bartender:
“listen, he’s driving us
crazy with that
thing.
eventually, all the other
records are
rotated
but
Bonaparte’s Retreat


remains.
what does it
mean?”


“it’s his song,”


said Clyde.
“don’t you have a
song?”


well, I came in about one


p.m. this day
and all the regulars
were there
but Fred wasn’t
there.


I ordered my drink,


then said out loud,
“hey, where’s
Fred?”


“Fred’s dead,”


said Clyde.


I looked down at the end


of the bar.
the sun came through the


blinds
but there was nobody
at the end
stool.


“you’re kidding me,”


I said, “Fred’s back in the


crapper or
something.”


“Fred didn’t come in this


morning,” said Clyde, “so


I went over to his
hotel room
and there he
was
stiff as a
cigar
box.”
everybody was very
quiet.
those guys never said
much
anyhow.


“well,” I said, “at least


we won’t have to hear
Bonaparte’s Retreat
anymore.”


nobody said


anything.


“is that record


still in the
juke?” I
asked.


“yes,” said


Clyde.


“well,” I said,


“I’m going to play it
one more time.”


I got up.
“hold it,”


said Clyde.


he came around the bar,


walked to the
juke
box.


he had a little key


in his
hand.
he put the key
in the juke
and opened
it.


he reached in


and pulled
out a
record.


then he took the


record and
broke it over
his
knee.


“it was his


song,” said
Clyde.


then he locked


the juke,
took the broken
record
behind the bar
and
trashed
it.


the name of the


bar
was
fewel’s.
it was at
Crenshaw and


Adams
and it’s not
there
anymore.


flat tire










got a flat on the freeway


11. a.m. going north


I got over to the side


a small strip on the freeway edge


got out the jack and the spare


went to work


the big rigs going by blasts of air and noise


shaking everything and to top it


all
it was cold an icy wind


and I thought, Jesus Christ, mercy, can I do this thing?


this would be a good place to go crazy and chuck it all in


but I got the


new wheel
on,
the old one
in the trunk
and then I was


back in the
car


I gunned it into


the swirl of
traffic


and there I was


like nothing
had ever
happened


moving along


with everybody


else


all of us


caught up in our


petty larcenies
and our
rotting
virtues


I gunned it


hard
made the fast
lane


pushed the


button
as my radio
antenna
sliced into the


sky.


oh, I was a ladies’ man!












you


wonder about
the time
when
you ran through women
like an open-field
maniac
with this total
disregard for
panties, dish towels,
photos
and all the other
accoutrements—
like
the tangling of
souls.


what


were you
trying to
do
trying to
catch up
with?


it was like a


hunt.
how many
could you
bag?
move
onto?


names


shoes
dresses


sheets, bathrooms


bedrooms, kitchens


back
rooms,
cafes,
pets,
names of pets,


names of children;


middle names, last


names, made-up
names.


you proved it was


easy.
you proved it
could be done
again and
again,
those legs held
high
behind most of
you.
or
they were on top
or
you were
behind
or
both
sideways
plus
other
inventions.
songs on radios.


parked cars.
telephone voices.
the pouring of
drinks.
the senseless
conversations.
now you know
you were nothing but a


fucking
dog,


a snail wrapped around


a snail—
sticky shells in the
sunlight, or in
the misty evenings,
or in the dark
dark.


you were


nature’s
idiot,
not proving but
being
proved.
not a man but a
plan
unfolding,
not thrusting but
being
pierced.
now
you know.


then


you thought you were


such a
clever devil
such a


cad
such a
man-bull
such a
bad boy


smiling over your


wine
planning your next
move


what a


waste of time
you were


you great


rider
you Attila of
the springs and
elsewhere


you could have


slept through it
all


and you would never


have been
missed


never would have


been
missed
at
all.

the bartender at Musso’s


remembers me when
* was in rags, used to


lean on the wood with the


worst and loudest of women


and
we would drink too much spill our drinks get


nasty.


now


I enter
quietly with an
interviewer
a film director
or some
actor
or
with my wife
and a gentle
friend or
two.


at times


now
I see the bartender
looking at me


and I know
he’s thinking
of back then
the way it
was
and I look
back at him
and my eyes
send the
message:
I’m just the


same, friend, only


the circumstances


have
altered
but
I’m
the same.


then I


turn back
to
whomever
I am with
and they
too
seem to be
thinking,
when is he
going to go
crazy
again?


nothing


to do,
friend,
but
wait


and


see.


creative writing class












I’m guilty, I did take one


in college
and the first thing I realized was that
I could beat the hell out of any
2 or 3 people in there
at once
(physically


* mean) and


of course
this was no way to measure creativity.


also


I noticed that the professor’s advice
on what to do
and what not to do
to become a writer was
very pale and standard stuff
that would lead to
nowhere.


some of the students’ work


was read in class
and I found it to be embarrassingly
inept.


I sat alone in the back row with


my scowl
further noting that
the men didn’t look like men and
the women didn’t look like women.
again


no way to judge creativity.


but what they produced
looked like
what they were.
well
at least the prof did give me


“A’s” on all the work
I turned in
but I got a “B” overall for
poor attendance.


I also knew that


every student in that class


except one
was
creatively doomed.


and even that one


would be 50 years old
before even minor notice
would be taken of
his work.


a bit longer


than even he
had
expected.


cool black air










often from my typing room I step out onto this small balcony
and there is the night
a cool wash of black air.


I stand in slippers, shorts and undershirt, sucking at a small cigarette, I can see the curling headlights of the cars on the winding Harbor Freeway.


they come and come, those lights, they never stop and I truly wonder that life is still here


after all these centuries, after the hell of all of our error and our smallness and our greed, our
selfishness, our bitterness,
life is still here


and the thought of that makes me strangely elated.
of course, I am woozy from hours of
typing.


and now


the same dog in that yard to the far left barks at me again.


he should know that old fart standing there in his shorts, he should know me by now.


I turn and walk back into my typing room.


the typewriter is electric and it is on and it hums hums hums hums.


last night I did something very odd: after ripping out
a few poems


I covered the machine
then bent down and kissed it once, and said, “thank you, very much.”


after 50 years in the game I had finally thanked my typewriter.


now I sit down to it and I BANG IT, I don’t use the light touch, I BANG IT, I want to hear it, I want it to do its tricks, it has saved my ass from the worst of women and the worst of men and the


worst of jobs, it has mellowed my nightmares into a gentle sanity, it has loved me at my lowest and it has made me seem to be a greater soul than I ever was.


I BANG IT I BANG IT


and I know how all of them felt, all the writers, when it was going good, when it was going hot.


death, I have chopped off your arms and your legs and your head.


I am sorry, I know you just do what you have to do


even to that barking dog


but now


I BANG IT
BANG IT


and wait.


the jackals










as the years went on I seemed to have more luck but now these jackals


these attackers from the past reappear as if nothing had ever


occurred (one doesn’t mind literary criticism so long as the envy and the rancor do not show through)
and now I meet the jackals in eating
places etc.
some even come to the door


bringing entire families—mothers, fathers, old aunts…


the jackals turn on the charm


and I don’t mind, let the past be
done, I pour the drinks and
listen.


it is afterwards that it occurs, usually


within a week:
a large manuscript arrives with
note: “could you read this?
publisher would like a foreword from
you…”


I brace myself, flop on the bed, give it


a read: the writing is proficient
but somewhere there is a terrible
lacking, an unnatural void…
the manuscript makes me a bit ill;
I let it fall to the
floor.


the other night I made a brief


appearance at a theater where my


video was showing and
as I was leaving
here came the poet, glass of
cheap free wine in his hand, he
poked his face into mine


and repeated his same speech all


over again as if he had forgotten
he had given it
to me before.


“remember me? we met at L’s.


there’s this new mag starting, it’s
going to be better than Rolling
Stone…
what they want me to do is
interview you and you interview me,


we get a thousand a-piece, maybe


more…”


(said jackal had attacked me in an


article after begging me to go
to the boxing matches with him.
his face was continually
in mine, talking, talking,
“listen,” I told him, “let’s just
watch the fights…”
he had told
me he was there to cover the
fights, but he wasn’t: the
article was about me: a
terrible human being who was a
drunk and far past his prime.)


now he kept shoving his face into


mine there on the sidewalk,
repeating his spiel: “I interview


you, you interview me…one
thousand, what do you think, huh,


huh?”
“I’ll let you know,” I told
him.


but he just kept walking along,


pushing his face into mine…


well, I thought, I am going to


have to punch him out.


but I tried something else


first:


“get the fuck away from me!”


he backed off and I walked off


to a better place…


give it a week, I came in from the


track one evening and here was a


large package: 3 of his latest
books from a local press.
I flipped through the pages:
a breezy, bantering style
playing the open, good
human guy but it was like he
was writing on benzedrine
lashing you with shreds of his
soul,
but it was more boring-than
derring-do.


there was a note with phone


number, home address:
“I’ll interview you, you


interview me, the editor thinks
it’s a great idea…and there’s a
grand a-piece in it for each of
us, maybe more…”
I walked into the kitchen and
dumped him into the trash
bag.


I fed the cats and then the phone


rang.
it was a new voice:


“Chinaski?”


“yes?”


“listen, you don’t know me


but my name is Dipper
and I got a great deal for
you.”


“listen, how did you get my


phone number?”


“hey, man, what difference


does that make?”


I hung up.


in a moment the phone was ringing


again.


I walked into the front room


looked out the south window, it
looked fine out there: trees, lawn,


shrubbery,
not a jackal in


sight.


warm light










alone


tonight
in this house,
alone with
6 cats
who tell me
without
effort
all that there
is
to know.


in the shadow of the rose


Dinosauria, we










born like this


into this
as the chalk faces smile
as Mrs. Death laughs
as the elevators break
as political landscapes dissolve


as the supermarket bag boy holds a college degree as the oily fish spit out their oily prey as the sun is masked


we are


born like this
into this
into these carefully mad wars


into the sight of broken factory windows of emptiness into bars where people no longer speak to each other into fist fights that end as shootings and knifings


born into this


into hospitals which are so expensive that it’s cheaper to die into lawyers who charge so much it’s cheaper to plead guilty into a country where the jails are full and the madhouses closed into a place where the masses elevate fools into rich heroes


born into this


walking and living through this
dying because of this
muted because of this
castrated
debauched
disinherited
because of this
fooled by this


used by this
pissed on by this
made crazy and sick by this
made violent
made inhuman
by this


the heart is blackened


the fingers reach for the throat
the gun
the knife
the bomb
the fingers reach toward an unresponsive god


the fingers reach for the bottle


the pill
the powder


we are born into this sorrowful deadliness


we are born into a government 60 years in debt
that soon will be unable to even pay the interest on that debt


and the banks will burn
money will be useless


there will be open and unpunished murder in the streets it will be guns and roving mobs land will be useless


food will become a diminishing return nuclear power will be taken over by the many explosions will continually shake the earth radiated robot men will stalk each other


the rich and the chosen will watch from space platforms
Dante’s Inferno will be made to look like a children’s playground


the sun will not be seen and it will always be night trees will die
all vegetation will die
radiated men will eat the flesh of radiated men
the sea will be poisoned


the lakes and rivers will vanish
rain will be the new gold


the rotting bodies of men and animals will stink in the dark wind


the last few survivors will be overtaken by new and hideous diseases and the space platforms will be destroyed by attrition the petering out of supplies
the natural effect of general decay


and there will be the most beautiful silence never heard


born out of that.


the sun still hidden there


awaiting the next chapter.

It’s never quite right, he said, the way the people look, the way the music sounds, the way the words are written.
it’s never quite right, he said, all the things we are


taught, all the loves we chase, all the deaths we
die, all the lives we live,
they are never quite right,
they are hardly close to right,
these lives we live
one after the other,
piled there as history,
the waste of the species,
the crushing of the light and the way,
it’s not quite right,
it’s hardly right at all
he said.


don’t I know it? I


answered.


I walked away from the mirror.


it was morning, it was afternoon, it was
night


nothing changed


it was locked in place.
something flashed, something broke, something remained.


I walked down the stairway and


into it.


a good job












some jobs you like,


there is a clean gentle
feel to some of them,
like the one I had
unloading boxcars
of frozen
fish.


the fish came packed


in coffin-sized boxes,
beautifully
heavy and
almost
unyielding.
you had thick gloves
and a hook
and you gaffed the
damned thing
and pulled it along
the floor and slid it
outside and onto the
waiting
truck.


and strangely there


was no foreman,
they just turned us
loose in there
knowing we’d get
it done.


we were always
sending out one of


the fellows for another


bottle of
wine.
it was slippery and
cold in those
boxcars


we yanked out those


iced fish,
drank the wine
and the bullshit
flew.
there was a
fight or two
but nothing really
violent.


I was the peacemaker.


“come on, fuck


that stuff!
let’s get these
fish out of
here!


yeah!”


then we’d be
laughing and
bullshitting
again.


toward evening


we all got quiet.
the fish seemed to
get heavier and
heavier.
shins got cracked,
knees
bruised


and the wine
settled heavily
into our
guts.
by the time you


got to your last box


you bullied it
out of there
strictly on nerve
alone.


when you punched


out
even the timecard


seemed
heavy.


and then you were


in your old car
moving toward
your place,
your shackjob,
wondering


whether good times


or hell
awaited
you.


but the frozen fish


you had
worked,
that thought was
pleasant and
soothing,


and you’d be back


for more,
hooking the wood
and dragging.


the night came


on and you flicked


the headlights
on


and the world was


good enough,
right
then.


last seat at the end












I was always studying the wood of the


bar, the grains, the scratches, the
cigarette burns.
there was something there but I
couldn’t quite figure what it
was
and that kept me going.


another one was to look at my


hand around the
glass.
there is something about
one’s hand about a
glass that is gently
fascinating.


and, of course, there is this one:


all drunks do it:
taking your thumbnail and slowly
ripping off the label
on a bottle of beer that has been
soaking in the icewater.


smoking cigarettes is a good show


too, especially in the early morning
hours with the Venetian blinds at
your back,
the smoke curls up and forms its
divergent patterns.
this gives one the feeling of
peace
and really so, more so,
if there is one of your favorite


old songs
emanating from the
juke.


and if the bartender was old


and a little tired and a little bit


wise
it was good to see where he


was or what he was doing—


washing glasses or leaning


against the counter or
sneaking a quick
shot
or whatever he was doing
it was always nice to just
see a bit of him,
to take note of the white
shirt.
the white shirt was an
important backdrop to
drink to and
with.


also you listened to the


traffic going by,
car by car.
it was not a deliberate


listening—more an offhand


one.
and it was best when
it had rained
and you could hear the
tires on the
wet street.


the bar was the best


place to hide in.
time came under your
control, time to wade


in, time to do nothing


in.
no guru was needed,


no god.


nothing expected but


yourself
and nothing lost
to the
unexpected.


my uncle Jack










my uncle Jack


is a mouse
is a house on fire
is a war about to begin
is a man running down the street with a knife in his back.


my uncle Jack


is the Santa Monica pier
is a dusty blue pillow
is a scratching black-and-white dog
is a man with one arm lighting a cigarette with one hand.


my uncle Jack


is a slice of burnt toast
is the place you forgot to look for the key


is the pleasure of finding 3 rolls of toilet paper in the closet is the worst dream you’ve ever had that you can’t remember.


my uncle Jack


is the firecracker that went off in your hand
is your run-over cat dead outside your driveway at 10:30 a.m.
is the crap game you won in the Santa Anita parking lot


is the man your woman left you for that night in the cheap hotel room.


my uncle Jack


is your uncle Jack
is death coming like a freight train
is a clown with weeping eyes


is your car jack and your fingernails and the scream of the biggest mountain now.


the area of pause












you have to have it or the walls will close in.
you have to give everything up, throw it
away, everything away.
you have to look at what you look at
or think what you think
or do what you do
or
don’t do
without considering personal
advantage
without accepting guidance.


people are worn away with


striving,
they hide in common
habits.
their concerns are herd
concerns.


few have the ability to stare


at an old shoe for
ten minutes
or to think of odd things
like who invented the
doorknob?


they become unalive


because they are unable to
pause
undo themselves
unkink
unsee


unlearn
roll clear.


listen to their untrue


laughter, then
walk
away.

have not?


is Whitman laughing at me from his grave?


does Creeley care?


is this properly spaced?


am I?

soothe me!


get me lucky!


get me good!


get me going!


I am a virgin again.


a 70 year old virgin.


don’t fuck me, machine


do.


who cares?
talk to me, machine!


we can drink together.


we can have fun.


think of all the people who will hate me at this computer.
we’ll add them to the others
and continue right
on.


so this is the beginning


not the
end.


Rossini, Mozart and Shostakovich












are who I will hear tonight


after reading about the death of Red Grange.
my wife and I ate at a Japanese restaurant tonight and I told her that Red Grange had died. I had red bean ice cream for dessert.
my wife declined.
the war was still on in the Gulf.
we got into the car and I drove us back here.
now I am listening to Rossini
who died before Red Grange.
now the audience is applauding.
now the players are readying for Mozart.
Red Grange got a hell of a write-up in the papers.
now Mozart is beginning.
I am smoking a small cigarette imported from India.
4 of my 6 cats are asleep in the next room.
my wife is downstairs.
outside it is a cold, still winter night.
I blow smoke into the desk lamp and watch it curl.
Mozart is doing very well.
Shostakovich is getting ready.
it is a late Tuesday evening.
and Red Grange is dead.


it’s a shame












a great mind and a good body seldom go together.
or a great body and a good
mind.
or a great body and a great
mind.


but worse, a not so good mind and a


not so good body often go
together.


in fact, that’s almost the entire


populace.
and all these
reproducing more of
themselves.


is there any wonder why the world


is where it’s at
now?


just notice the creature sitting near you


in a movie house
or standing ahead of you in a
supermarket line.
or giving a State of the Union
Address.


that the gods have let us go on


this long
this badly.
as the snail comes crawling home


to manna.


what a writer










what I liked about e. e. cummings


was that he cut away from
the holiness of the
word
and with charm
and gamble
gave us lines
that sliced through the
dung.


how it was needed!


how we were withering
away
in the old
tired
manner.


of course, then came all


the
e. e. cummings
copyists.
they copied him then
as the others had
copied Keats, Shelley,
Swinburne, Byron, et
al.


but there was only


one
e. e. cummings.
of course.
one sun.


one moon.


one poet,


like
that.


hangovers












I’ve probably had about more of them


than any person alive
and they haven’t killed me
yet
but some of those mornings felt
awfully near
death.


as you know, the worst drinking is done


on an empty stomach, while smoking


heavily and downing many different
types of
libations.


and the worst hangovers are when you


awaken in your car or in a strange room


or in an alley or in jail.


the worst hangovers are when you


awaken to realize that you have done


something absolutely vile, ignorant and


possibly dangerous the night before


but
you can’t quite remember what it
was.


and you awaken in various states of


disorder—parts of your body
damaged, your money missing
and/or possibly and often your
car, if you had one.
you might place a telephone call to


a lady, if you were with one, most


often to have her slam the phone


down on you.
or, if she is next to you then,


to feel her bristling and outrageous


anger.


drunks are never forgiven.


but drunks will forgive themselves


because they need to drink
again.


it takes an ungodly durability to


be a drinking person for many
decades.


your drinking companions are


killed by it.
you yourself are in and out of
hospitals
where the warning often is:
“One more drink will kill
you.”
but
you beat that
by taking more than one more
drink.


and as you near three quarters of


a century in age
you find that it takes more and more


booze to get you
drunk.


and the hangovers are worse,


the recovery stage is
longer.


and the most remarkably stupid


thing is
that you are not unpleased that


you have done it
all
and that you are still
doing it.


I am typing this now


under the yoke of one of my
worst hangovers
while downstairs now
sit various and sundry
bottles of
alcohol.


it’s all been so beastly


lovely,
this mad river,
this gouging
plundering
madness
that I would wish upon
nobody
but myself,
amen.


they are everywhere












the tragedy-sniffers are all


about.
they get up in the morning
and begin to find things
wrong
and they fling themselves
into a rage about
it,
a rage that lasts until
bedtime,
where even there
they twist in their
insomnia,
not able to rid their
minds
of the petty obstacles
they have
encountered.


they feel set against,


it’s a plot.
and by being constantly
angry they feel that
they are constantly
right.


you see them in traffic


honking wildly
at the slightest
infraction,
cursing,
spewing their
invectives.


you feel them


in lines
at banks
at supermarkets
at movies,
they are pressing
at your back
walking on your
heels,


they are impatient to


a fury.


they are everywhere


and into
everything,
these violently
unhappy
souls.


actually they are


frightened,
never wanting to be


wrong
they lash out
incessantly…
it is a malady
an illness of
that
breed.


the first one


I saw like that
was my
father


and since then
I have seen a


thousand
fathers,
ten thousand
fathers
wasting their lives


in hatred,
tossing their lives


into the
cesspool
and
ranting
on.


war










war, war, war,


the yellow monster,
the eater of mind
and body.
war,
the indescribable,
the pleasure of
the mad,
the final argument
of
ungrown men.


does it belong?


do we?


as we approach


the last flash of
our chance.


one flower left.


one second.


breathing like this.


the idiot










I believe the thought came to me


when I was about eleven years
old:
I’ll become an idiot.


I had noticed some in the neighborhood,


those who the people called
“idiots.”


although looked down upon,


the idiots seemed to have the
more peaceful lives:
nothing was expected of
them.


I imagined myself standing upon


streetcorners, hands in pockets,
and drooling a bit at the
mouth.


nobody would bother


me.


I began to put my plan into


effect.


I was first noticed in the


school yards.
my mates jibed at me,
taunted me.
even my father noticed:


“you act like a god damned


idiot!”
one of my teachers noticed,


Mrs. Gredis of the long silken


legs.


she kept me after


class.


“what is it, Henry?


you can tell me…”


she put her arms


about me
and I rested myself
against
her.


“tell me, Henry, don’t


be afraid…”


I didn’t say


anything.


“you can stay here


as long as you
want, Henry.
you don’t have to
talk…”


she kissed me on the


forehead
and I reached down
and lightly touched
one of her silken
legs.


Mrs. Gredis was a


hot number.


she kept me after


school almost every
day.
and everybody hated
me
but I believe that I


had the most wonderful


hard-ons
of any eleven year old


boy
in the city of
Los Angeles


this rejoinder










the people survive to come up with flat fists full of nothing.


I remember Carl Sandburg’s poem, “The People, Yes.”


nice thought but completely inaccurate: the people did not survive through a noble strength but through lie, compromise and guile.


I lived with these people, I am not so sure what people Sandburg lived with.
but his poem always pissed me off.
it was a poem that lied.
it is “The People, No.”
then and now.
and it doesn’t take a misanthrope to
say this.


let us hope that future famous poems


such as Mr. Sandburg’s
make more
sense.


Hemingway never did this










I read that he lost a suitcase full of manuscripts on a train and that they never were recovered. I can’t match the agony of this


but the other night I wrote a 3-page poem upon this computer
and through my lack of diligence and
practice
and by playing around with commands
on the menu
I somehow managed to erase the poem
forever.


believe me, such a thing is difficult to do even for a novice
but I somehow managed to do
it.


now I don’t think this 3-pager was immortal but there were some crazy wild lines, now gone forever.
it bothers more than a touch, it’s something like knocking over a good bottle of wine.


and writing about it hardly makes a good poem.
still, I thought somehow you’d like to
know?


if not, at least you’ve read this far


and there could be better work
down the line.
let’s hope so, for your sake


and
mine.


surprise time again












it’s always a surprise to some


when the killer is that clean-cut
quiet boy with the gentle smile
who went to church
and was nearly a straight-A
student
and also good on the athletic
field,
kind to his elders,
adored by the young girls,
the old ones,
admired by his
peers.


“I can’t believe he did it…”


they always think a killer must


be ugly, gross, unlikable,
that he must give off signs,
signals of anger and
madness.


sometimes these kill


too.


but a potential killer can never


be judged by his
externals


nor a politician, a priest or


a poet.
or the dog


or the woman
wagging
tails.


the killer sits anywhere


like you
as you read this


wondering.


young in New Orleans












starving there, sitting around the bars,


and at night walking the streets for
hours,
the moonlight always seemed fake
to me, maybe it was,
and in the French Quarter I watched
the horses and buggies going by,
everybody sitting high in the open
carriages, the black driver, and in
back the man and the woman,
usually young and always white.
and I was always white.
and hardly charmed by the
world.
New Orleans was a place to
hide.
I could piss away my life,
unmolested.
except for the rats.
the rats in my dark small room
very much resented sharing it
with me.
they were large and fearless
and stared at me with eyes
that spoke
an unblinking
death.


women were beyond me.


they saw something
depraved.
there was one waitress
a little older than


I, she rather smiled,
lingered when she
brought my
coffee.
that was plenty for
me, that was
enough.


there was something about


that city, though:
it didn’t let me feel guilty


that I had no feeling for the


things so many others
needed.
it let me alone.


sitting up in my bed


the lights out,
hearing the outside
sounds,
lifting my cheap
bottle of wine,
letting the warmth of
the grape
enter
me
as I heard the rats
moving about the
room,
I preferred them
to
humans.


being lost,


being crazy maybe
is not so bad
if you can be
that way:


undisturbed.


New Orleans gave me


that.
nobody ever called
my name.
no telephone,
no car,
no job,
no
anything.


me and the


rats
and my youth,
one time,
that time
I knew
even through the
nothingness,
it was a
celebration
of something not to
do
but only
know.


the damnation of Buk










getting old, and older, concerned that


you might not get your driver’s license
renewed, concerned that the hangovers
last longer, concerned that you might
not reach the age of 85,
concerned that the poems will stop
arriving.
concerned that you are concerned.


concerned that you might die in the


spa.
concerned that you might die on the
freeway while driving in from the
track.
concerned that you might die in your
lap pool.
concerned that the remainder of your
teeth
will not last.


concerned about dying but not about


death.


concerned that people will no longer


consider you dangerous when
drunk.


concerned that you will forget who


the enemy is.


concerned that you will forget how to


laugh.


concerned that there will be nothing to


drink in hell.
and concerned you will have to
listen to
one poetry reading
after another
after another…


the Los Angeles poets


the New York poets
the Iowa poets


the black poets


the white poets
the Chicano poets
the 3rd world poets


the female poets


the homosexual poets
the lesbian poets
the bisexual poets
the sexless poets
the failed poets
the famous poets
the dead poets
the etc. poets


concerned that the toteboard will


explode into flowers of
shit


and the night will never


come.


Charles the Lion-Hearted










he’s 95, lives in a large two story


house.


“they want to send me to a rest


home. ‘hell,’ I tell them, ‘this
IS my home!’”


he speaks of his grandchildren.


he’s outlived his
children.


he visits his wife who’s also


95.
she’s in a rest
home.


“she looks great but she doesn’t


know who I am.”


he lives on bacon, tomatoes and


breakfast cereal.


he lives on a steep hill.


used to take his little dog for
walks.
the dog died.


he walks alone now,


straight-backed,
carrying an
oak cane.
he’s 6 foot two,


lean,
jocular,
imposing.
“they can’t wait for me to
die, they want my house
and money.
I’m gonna live just to
spite them.”


I see him in his room upstairs


at night
watching tv or
reading.


he was married longer than


most men
live.
he still is


only she doesn’t know she’s


married.


he sits up in his room


on top of nine and one
half
decades
neither asking nor
giving
mercy.


he is an ocean of


wonder,
he is a shining
rock.


quick of mind,


so quick.
when death comes for


him
it should be
ashamed.


I so want to see that light burning


in that upstairs
window!


when it goes dark


it will be another world
not quite so magic
not quite so good


when it goes dark.

I suppose Jr. High was the worst.


my friend Teddy began going to
various dances
and talking about it all.
his father loaned him the car
for these
functions.


he also had a new wrist watch.


it was still the depression
era and few of us boys
had wrist
watches.


Teddy kept lifting up his wrist


and looking at his
watch.
he did it 3 or 4 times
within a ten minute
period.


“why the hell do you keep


looking at the time?
you going
somewhere?”


“maybe, maybe…”


“well, go on then…”


“she kissed me at the
doorway, I can still feel her


lips!”


“whose lips?”


“Annabell’s, she kissed me
at her door after the
dance!”


“listen, Teddy, let’s go down to the


lot and get up a
baseball game.”


“I can’t get her out of my mind.


her lips were soft,
warm…”


“Christ, man, who


cares?”


“I bought her a corsage for


the dance, she looked so
beautiful…”


“didn’t you slip her any


turkey neck?”


“what?


listen, I’m in love!”


“well, that’s what you do


then before somebody
else slams her.”


“don’t talk that way, I’m


warning you!”


“I can take you, Teddy,
with one ball tied behind


my back.”


he looked at his watch:


“I gotta go now…”
“gonna go play with yourself,


Teddy?”


“look who’s talking!


you don’t even have a
girl!”


“you don’t know what I


have.”


“you’ve got nothing but


your hand.”


“I’ve got two hands, Teddy.”


I grabbed him by the shirt and


pulled him in
close.


“and just for laughs I just might


kick your ass, real
good.”


“you’re just pissed because


you’ve got
nobody!”


I let him go.


“get out of here…”


Teddy turned and
walked off.


he’d gotten off easy that


time.
next time I’d kick his ass
from stem to
stern.
it was 1935.


I was standing in my parents’


back yard.
it was a Saturday
afternoon.


my father was in the house


listening to the radio,
the Trojans were playing
Notre Dame.
my mother was in there
doing something and
nothing.


I walked in through the back


door.
my mother was in the
kitchen.


“Henry, I saw Teddy


leaving.
he’s a nice
boy.”


“yeah…”


“I saw Teddy


all dressed up to go to
the dance.
he looked so
nice!”
“yeah…”


“Henry, when are you going


to get a nice girl to take to
a dance?”


“I only dance with them in


bed!”
“YOU DON’T TALK THAT WAY
TO YOUR MOTHER!”


it was my father.


he had been standing there.
it must have been half
time.


“don’t bother me,” I


said.


“I’LL BOTHER YOU, I’LL BOTHER YOU SO YOU’LL NEVER TALK THAT WAY AGAIN!”


“is that right, old man?


come on then, bother
me!”


he stood there.


I stood there.


nothing happened.


“ALL RIGHT,” he screamed,


“GO TO YOUR ROOM!
NOW!”


I walked past him, on through
the house and out the


door.


I walked down the street.


I had no money, I had nowhere to


go.
I just kept
walking.


it was a hot summer day


and I just kept walking,
3 blocks, 4 blocks, 5
blocks…


then I passed a mongrel dog


going the other
way.


his fur was matted and dirty


and his tongue hung out of
one side of his
mouth.


I stopped, turned and watched


him trot
off.


then I faced the other way and


continued my
journey.


classical music and me












I have no idea how it began.


as a boy I believed that classical music was for sissies and as a teenager I felt this even more strongly.


yes, I think it began in this record


store.
I was in my booth listening to whatever I
listened to
at that time.
then I heard some music in the next
booth.
the sounds seemed very strange and
unusual.
I saw the man leave his booth and
return the record to the clerk.
I went to the clerk and asked for that
record.
she handed it to me.
I looked at the cover.


“but,” I said, “this is symphony


music.”


“yes,” said the clerk.


I took the record to my booth


and played it.


never had I heard such


music.
unfortunately, I no longer
remember what that


piece of marvelous
music was.
I purchased the record.


I had a record player in my


room.
I listened to the record
over and over
again.


I was hooked.


soon I found a 2nd hand


record store.
there I found that you could


turn in 3 record albums and


get two back.


I was fairly poor


but most of my money went


for wine and
classical music.
I loved to mix the two
together.


I went through that entire


2nd hand record
store.


my tastes were strange.


I liked Beethoven but
preferred Brahms and
Tchaikovsky.
Borodin didn’t work.
Chopin was only good
at moments.
Mozart was only good
when I was feeling
good and I seldom


felt that
way.
Smetana I found
obvious and Sibelius
awesome.


Ives was too self-comfortable.


Goldmark, I felt, was very
underrated.


Wagner was a roaring miracle


of dark energy.
Haydn was love turned loose


into sound.
Handel created things that
took your head and lifted it
to the ceiling.
Eric Coates was unbelievably


cute and astute.
and if you listened to Bach
long enough
you didn’t want to listen to
anybody else.
there were dozens
more….


I was on the move from


city to city
and carrying a record player


and records along was
impossible
so I began listening to the
radio
and picking up what I
could.


the problem with the radio


was
that there were a few standard
works they played over and


over.
I heard them too often
and could anticipate each note
before it
arrived.
but the good part was
that, at times, I heard new
music that I had never heard
before by composers I had
never heard of, read about.
I was surprised at the many
composers, fairly unknown,
at least to me, who could
produce these wondrous
and stirring
works.
works that I would never
hear again.


I have continued to listen to


classical music via the radio
for decades.
I am listening as I write
this to Mahler’s 9th.
Mahler was always one
of my favorites.
it’s possible to listen to
his works again and
again without
tiring of
them.


through the women, through


the jobs, through the horrible
times and the good times,


through deaths, through everything,


in and out of hospitals,
in and out of love, through the


decades that have gone so
swiftly
there have been so many
nights of listening
to classical music on the
radio.
almost every
night.


I wish I could remember the name of


the piece I first heard in that
record booth
but it evades me.
for some odd reason I do
remember the conductor:
Eugene Ormandy.
one of the
finest.


now Mahler is in the room


with me
and the chills run up my
arms, reach the back
of my neck…
it’s all so unbelievably
splendid,
splendid!
and I can’t read a note of
music.
But I have found a part of
the world


like no other part of the


world.
it gave heart to my
life, helped me get
to
here.


transport










I was a scraggly bum most of my


life
and to get from one city to another
I took the buses.
I don’t know how many times I
saw the Grand Canyon,
going east to west
and west to east.
it was just dusty windows,
the backs of necks, stop-offs at
intolerable eating places
and always the old
constipation
blues.
and once, a half-assed romance
with no socially redeeming
value.


then I found myself riding the


trains.
the food was beautiful
and the restrooms were
lovely
and I stayed in the bar
cars.
some of them were
so grand:
round curving picture
windows
and large overhead
domes,
the sun shone right on
down through your


glass
and at night you could
get
stinko
and watch the stars and
the moon ride
right along with
you.


and the best, since there was more


space
people weren’t forced
to speak to
you.


then after the trains I found


myself on the
jetliners,
quick trips to cities and
back.
I was like many of the
others:
I had a briefcase
and was writing on pieces
of paper.
I was on the hustle.
and I hustled and hounded the
stewardesses for drink after
drink.
the food and the view were
bad.
and the people tended to
talk to you
but there were ways to
discourage
that.
the worst about flying was that
there were people waiting for
you at the airports.


baggage was no problem:
you had your carry-on bag,


change of underwear, socks,


one shirt, toothbrush, razor,
liquor.
then the jetliners stopped.
you stayed in the city,
you shacked with unsavory
ladies and you purchased a
series of old cars.
you were much luckier with the


cars than with the
ladies.
you bought the cars for a
song
and drove them with a classic


abandon.
they never needed an oil
change and they lasted and
lasted.
on one the springs were
broken.
on another they stuck up
out of the seat and into your
ass.
one had no reverse
gear.
this was good for me,
it was like playing a game of
chess—


keeping your King from getting


checkmated.
another would only start
when parked on a
hill.
there was one where the


lights wouldn’t go on until you


hit a bump
HARD.


of course, they all died


finally.
and it was always a true
heartbreaker for me when
I had to watch them towed off
to the junkyard.


another I lost when it was impounded


on a drunk driving
rap.


they sent me an impound bill that was


four times larger than the purchase


price
so I let them keep
it.


the best car I ever had was the one


my first wife gave me when divorcing


me.
it was two years old,
as old as our marriage.


but the last car was (and is)


the very best, purchased new for
$30,000 cash. (well, I wrote
them a check).
it has everything: air bag,
anti-lock brakes, everything.


also, 2 or 3 times a year


people send a limousine
so we can attend various
functions.
these are very nice
because you can drink like
hell and not worry about the
drunk tank.


but I’m going to bypass that


private plane, that private
boat.
upkeep and rental space
can be a real pain in the
butt.


I’ll tell you one thing, though,


one night not so long
ago
I had a dream that I
could fly.
I mean, just by working
my arms and my legs
I could fly through the
air
and I did.


there were all these people


on the ground,
they were reaching up their


arms and trying to pull me
down
but
they couldn’t do
it.


I felt like pissing on


them.
they were so
jealous.


all they had to do was


to work their way
slowly up to it
as I had
done.
such people think


success grows on


trees.


you and I,


we know
better.


betrayed










the big thrill


was being quite young and
reading Of Time and the
River
by Thomas Wolfe.
what a fat and wondrous
book!
I read it again and
again.


then a couple of decades


went by
and I read the book
again.


I disliked the poetic prose


right off.
I put the book down and
looked about the
room.


I felt cheated.


the thrill was gone.


I decided to leave town.


I was in Los Angeles.


two days later I was sitting on a


Greyhound bus
going to Miami.


and I had a pint of whiskey


in one pocket
and a paperback copy of


Fathers and Sons
in the
other.


torched-out












the worst was closing the bars at


2 a.m.
with my lady.
going home to get a couple hours
sleep,
then as a substitute postal carrier
to be on call at
5:30 a.m.
sitting there with the other
subs
along the little ledge
outside the magazine
cases.


too often given a route to


case and carry,
starting 15 or 20 minutes
late,
the sweat pouring down
your face,
gathering under the
armpits.
you’re dizzy, sick,
trying to get the case
up, pull it down and
sack it for the truck to
pick up.


you worked on sheer


nerve,
reaching down into the
gut,
flailing, fighting


as the last minutes,
the last
seconds
rushed toward
you.


then to get on the


route with the people
and the dogs,
to make the rounds
on a new
route,
making your legs
go,
making your feet
walk
as the sun baked
you alive,
you fought through
your first
round
with 6 or 7 more to
go.
never time for lunch,
you’d get a write-up
if you were 5 minutes
late.


a few too many writeups


and you were
finished,
they moved you
out.


it was a living, a


deathly
living, to somehow
finish your route,
come in and often


be told
you were assigned
to the night pickup
run, another
ball-buster.
or
if you got out of that
to drive on in
to your place
to find your lady
already drunk,
dirty dishes in the
sink,
the dog unfed,


the flowers unwatered,


the bed
unmade,
the ashtrays full of
punched-out
lipstick-smeared
cigarettes.


then to get in the tub


with a beer.
you were no longer
young,
you were no longer
anything,
just worn down and
out
with your lady in the
other room
lisping inanities and
insanities,
pouring her glasses
of cheap
wine.


you were always going


to get rid of her,
you were working on
that,
you were caught between
the post office and
her,
it was the vise of
death,
each side crushing in
upon you.


“Jesus, baby, please,


please, just shut up for
a little while…”


“ah, you asshole!


what’re you doing in
there, playing with
yourself?”


to come roaring out


of that tub, all the impossibilities


of that day and that life
corkscrewing through you
ripping away
everything.


out of that tub,


a naked, roaring rocket
of battered body and
mind:


“YOU GOD DAMNED WHORE,


WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT


ANYTHING?
SITTING THERE ON YOUR
DEAD ASS AND


SUCKING AT THE VINO!”


to rush into the other room,


looking all about,
the walls whirling,
the entire world tilting in
against you.
“DON’T HIT ME! DON’T HIT
ME!
YOU’D HIT ME BUT YOU
WOULDN’T HIT A
MAN!”


“HELL NO, I WOULDN’T


HIT A MAN, YOU THINK
I’M CRAZY?”


to grab the bottle from


her,
to drain damn near
half of it.
to find another bottle,
open it,
pour a tall waterglass
full,
then to smash the glass
against a
wall,
to explode it like
that
in purple glory.


to find a new glass,


sit down and pour a
full one.


she’d be quiet
then.


we’d drink an
hour or so
like that.


then, to get


dressed,
cigarette dangling,
you are feeling somewhat
better.
then you are moving
toward the
door.


“hey! where the hell


you going?”


“I’m going to the fucking


bar!”


“not without me!


not without me, buster!”


“all right, get your ass


into gear!”


to walk there together.


to get our stools.
to sit before the long mirror.


the mirror you always hated to


look into.


to tell the bartender,


“vodka 7.”


to have her tell the bartender,


“scotch and water.”


everything was far away


then,
the post office, the world,


the past and the
future.


to have our drinks arrive.


to take the first hit in the


dark bar.


life couldn’t get any


better.


the word










there was Auden, I don’t remember


which small room I first read him
in


and there was Spender and I don’t


know which small room
either
and then there was Ezra
and I remember that room,
there was a torn screen
that the flies came through
and it was Los Angeles
and the woman said to me,
“Jesus Christ, you reading those
Cantos again!”
she liked e. e. cummings, though,
she thought he was really
good and she was
right.


I remember when I read Turgenev,


though, I had just come out of the
drunk tank and I was living
alone
and I thought he was really a
subtle and funny son of a
bitch.


Hemingway I read everywhere,


sometimes a few times over
and he made me feel brave
and tough
until one day
it all just stopped cold for me


and worse than that,
Ernie became an
irritant.


my Jeffers period was sometime


in Los Angeles, some room, some


job,
the same woman was back
and she said,
“Jesus, how can you read this
crap?”
one time when she was gone
I found many magazines
under the bed.
I pulled them out


and found that the contents were


all about murder
and it was all about women
who were tortured, killed,
dismembered and so
forth with the
lurid photos
in black and
white.
that stuff wasn’t for
me.


my first encounter with Henry


Miller was via paperback
on a bus through Arizona.
he was great when he stuck
to reality
but when he got ethereal
when he got to philosophizing
he got as dry and boring as
the passing
landscape.
I left him in the men’s crapper
at a hamburger


stop.


I got hold of Celine’s Journey


and read it straight through
while in bed eating crackers.


I kept reading, eating the
crackers and reading, reading,


laughing out loud,
thinking, at last I’ve met a man


who writes better than
I.
I finished the book and then
drank much water.
the crackers swelled up
inside of me
and I got the worst
god damned stomach
ache of my
life.


I was living with my first


wife.
she worked for the L.A.
Sheriff’s Dept.
and she came in to
find me doubled up
and moaning.


“Oh, what happened?”


“I’ve just read the world’s


greatest
writer!”


“But you said you were.”


“I’m second, baby…”


I read F. D.’s Notes from the


Underground
in a small El Paso
library
after sleeping the night
on a park bench
during a sand
storm.
after reading that book
I knew I had a long way
to go as a
writer.


I don’t know where I read


T. S. Eliot.
he made a small dent
which soon ironed
out.


there were many rooms,


many books,
D. H. Lawrence, Gorky,
A. Huxley, Sherwood
Anderson, Sinclair Lewis,
James Thurber, Dos Passos,


etc
Kafka.


Schopenhauer, Nietzsche,


Rabelais.
Hamsun.


as a very young man


I worked as a shipping clerk,


made the bars at
night,


came into the roominghouse,


went to bed
and read the


books.
I had 3 or 4 of them in
bed with me (what a
man!) and then I would
sleep.


my landlady finally told


me, “You know, you read those


books in bed and about every


hour or so one of them will
fall to the floor.
You are keeping everybody
awake!”


(I was on the 3rd floor.)


what days and nights those


were.


now I can’t read anything,


not even the newspaper.
and, of course, I can’t watch


tv except for the boxing
matches.
I do hear some news
on the car radio
while driving the freeway
and waiting for the
traffic
reports.


but you know, my former


life as a bibliophile, it
possibly kept me from
murdering somebody,
myself
included.
it kept me from being an


industrialist.
it allowed me to endure
some women


that most men would never


be able to live
with.
it gave me space, a
pause.
it helped me to write
this


(in this room,


like the other rooms)


perhaps for some young man


now
needing
to laugh at the
impossibilities
which are here
always
after we are
not.


shooting the moon in the eye












it was just a small room, no bathroom,


hot plate, bed, 2 chairs, a bed, sink,
phone in hall.
I was on the 2nd floor of a hotel.
I had a job.
I got in about 6:30 p.m.
and by 8 p.m.
there would be 4 or 5 people
in the room,
all drunks,
all drinking wine.
sometimes there would be
6 or 7.
most of them sat on the
bed.
oh, there was a radio,
we played the radio,
drank and
talked.


it was strange, there was


always a sense of
excitement there,
some laughter and
sometimes serious
arguments that were
somewhat
stupid.


we were never asked


to be quiet,
the manager never
bothered us,


or the
police.
with an exception
or two,
there were no
physical
confrontations.
I’d always call an
end to the parties
around 3 a.m.


“ah, come on Hank!


we’re just getting
started!”


“come on, come


on, everybody
out!”


and,


with an exception
or two,
I always slept
without a
lady.


we called


that place,
the Hotel from
Hell.


I had no idea


what we were
trying to
do.


I think we were
just celebrating


being
alive.


that small room


full of smoke and


music and
voices,
night after night
after
night.


the poor, the mad,


the lost.


we lit up that hotel


with our twisted
souls
and it loved
us.


nirvana










not much chance,


completely cut loose from
purpose,
he was a young man
riding a bus
through North Carolina
on the way to
somewhere
and it began to snow
and the bus stopped
at a little cafe
in the hills
and the passengers
entered.


he sat at the counter


with the others,
he ordered and the
food arrived.
the meal was
particularly
good
and the
coffee.


the waitress was


unlike the women
he had
known.
she was unaffected,
there was a natural
humor which came
from her.


the fry cook said
crazy things.
the dishwasher,
in back,
laughed, a good
clean
pleasant
laugh.


the young man watched


the snow through the
windows.


he wanted to stay


in that cafe
forever.


the curious feeling


swam through him
that everything
was
beautiful
there,
that it would always
stay beautiful
there.


then the bus driver


told the passengers
that it was time
to board.


the young man


thought, I’ll just sit
here, I’ll just stay
here.
but then


he rose and followed


the others into the
bus.


he found his seat


and looked at the cafe


through the bus
window.


then the bus moved


off, down a curve,
downward, out of
the hills.


the young man


looked straight
forward.
he heard the other
passengers
speaking
of other things,
or they were
reading
or
attempting to
sleep.


they had not


noticed
the
magic.


the young man


put his head to
one side,
closed his
eyes,
pretended to
sleep.


there was nothing


else to do—
just listen to the
sound of the
engine,
the sound of the


tires
in the
snow.


an invitation










hey Chinaski:


I am a filmmaker in the Hollywood area and I am currently making a movie in which I would like to include you.


The nature of the movie is about an alcoholic Satan who decides to leave hell for a while and have a vacation in Hollywood.


This particular version of Satan is a fun guy who can’t get enough booze, SLUTS, or adventure.


Satan, while in Hollywood looks up his old buddies (Ghosts) Richard Burton, Errol Flynn and Idi Amin (still alive).


He proceeds to get smashed with these
guys and they all pass out on him so
he needs to look up a mortal worthy of
drinking with him (YOU).
The scene I have envisioned with you would be to be sitting around a crummy joint, drinking Mezcal and playing Russian Roulette with Satan while 2 big fat chicks are slapping each other with Salamis.


I would want everybody in the scene to be SMASHED.


I can tell you now that I couldn’t pay you anything up front xcept Booze and adventure.
—However—
I am going to hopefully be able to release this movie one day and would be happy to work out a contractual agreement that would arrange a royalty rate—(if you are
interested.)


And thanks for mentioning in your


writing, KNUT HAMSUN.
he has turned out to be one of my


faves.
And just remember,
WHEN IN DOUBT,
PASS OUT!


batting order:










Hemingway’s been in a slump,


can’t hit a curve ball
anymore,
I’m dropping him to the 6th
spot.
I’m putting Celine in
cleanup,
he’s inconsistent but when
he’s good there’s no
better.
Hamsun I’m going to use
in the number 3 spot,
he hits them hard and
often.
lead-off, well, lead-off
I’ll use e. e. cummings,
he’s fast, can beat out a
bunt.
I’ll use Pound in the
number two spot, Ezra
is one of the better
hit and run men
in the business.
the 5 spot I’ll give to
Dostoevsky,
he’s a heavy hitter, great with
men on base.
the 7 spot I’ll give to Robinson
Jeffers, can you think of anybody
better?
he can drill a rock
350 feet.
the 8 spot, I’ve got my
catcher, J. D. Salinger,


if we can find
him.
and pitching?
how about Nietzsche?
he’s strong!


been breaking all the tables


in the training
room.


coaches?


I’ll take Kierkegaard and


Sartre,
gloomy fellows,
but none know this
game better.


when we field this team,


it’s all over,
gentlemen.


we’re going to kick some


ass, most likely
yours.


the open canvas












listening to organ music on the radio


tonight,
the door to the small balcony is
open,
it is 11:07 p.m., cold, a night of
silence except for the
radio, the
organ music,
and I get this vision
of a thin, tall man at the keyboard,
he is more than pale, almost
* chalky white.


the music boils in the gloom.


the walls about him are unpainted, cold, austerely indifferent.






* full glass of wine sits untouched


on a rough hand-made table to his


right.


the music seeps through his


bones,
centuries bend and
unwind as the invisible dog
of darkness
walks by
in a half circle


behind him,
then blends into
neurons.
the man continues to
play.
the world turns upsidedown
with a fixed gentleness
but the walls, the man,
the sounds continue
as before.


then the world returns to its


natural course.


one tonality breeds


another.
the sounds of black strings
of beads.
the sound is one
yet not one.


then the music


stops.


the man sits.


he is thoughtless.


the keys of the organ assume


an immensity.


the walls about him move away


faster than the eye
can note,
then they
return.


the man coughs, looks to


his left,
looks down,
touches the keys and
is taken
again.


in the shadow of the rose












branching out, grubbing down,


taking stairways down to hell,
reestablishing the vanishing
point, trying a different
bat, a different stance, altering
diet and manner of
walking, readjusting the
system, photographing your
dinosaur dream,
driving your machine with
more grace and care,
noticing the flowers talking
to you,
realizing the gigantic agony
of the terrapin,
you pray for rain like an
Indian,
slide a fresh clip into the
automatic,
turn out the lights and
wait.
