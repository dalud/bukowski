for they had things to say






the canaries were there, and the lemon tree and the old woman with warts; and I was there, a child


and I touched the piano keys


as they talked—


but not too loudly


for they had things to say,


the three of them;


and I watched them cover the canaries at night with flour sacks:


“so they can sleep, my dear.”


I played the piano quietly


one note at a time,


the canaries under their sacks,


and there were pepper trees,


pepper trees brushing the roof like rain and hanging outside the windows like green rain,


and they talked, the three of them


sitting in a warm night’s semicircle,


and the keys were black and white


and responded to my fingers


like the locked-in magic


of a waiting, grown-up world;


and now they’re gone, the three of them and I am old:


pirate feet have trod


the clean-thatched floors


of my soul,


and the canaries sing no more.

evening class, 20 years later






the hungry tug of too late;


webs of needles,


the same trees are here;


and grass grown on grass


but the faces now are young


and as you walk across the campus thinking “memory is a poor excuse for the present” the legs want to let the body fall as
old images cling to you like mollusks and the girls now gone who once claimed your substance hang like broken shades


across the windows of your mind;


—at one time here


everything was mine—


now young lions claim the territory and look out casually over loose paws


and decide


mercifully


to let this poor game crawl by. he, of course, no match for the young lionesses, or the Spring in the early sky.


at one time here—


once—


I enter a room and stand against a wall and hear my name read, and no, it is not the same:


4




my old professor looked like a walrus as he spit my name out


into the spittoon of the world


and I said, HERE! while


feeling the sun run down


thru the hair of my head


like wires feeding life into life:


white rain, sea wild;


but this new one whispers my name (and it is dark); and like a claw reaching down into some pit of me, surrounded by walls like tombs I answer meekly, here,


and he moves on to another name.


I am older than he


and certainly not as fortunate


as the lionesses curl at his feet and purr delightedly,


and one gray old cat


twists its neck


and asks me: have you been here before?


yes, yes, yes, yes


* have been here before.

the snow of Italy






over my radio now


comes the sound of a truly mad organ, I can see some monk drunk in a cellar


mind gone or found,


talking to God in a different way;


I see candles and this man has a red beard as God has a red beard;


it is snowing, it is Italy, it is cold


and the bread is hard


and there is no butter,


only wine


wine in purple bottles


with giraffe necks,


and now the organ rises, again,


he violates it,


he plays it like a madman,


there is blood and spit in his beard, he wants to laugh but there isn’t time, the sun is going out, then his fingers slow,


now there is exhaustion and the dream,


yes, even holiness,


man going to man,


to the mountain, the elephant, the star, and a candle falls


but continues to burn upon its side, a wax puddle shining in the eyes of my red monk,


there is moss on the walls


and the stain of thought and failure and waiting,


6




then again the music comes like hungry tigers, and he laughs,


it is a child’s laugh, an idiot’s laugh,


laughing at nothing,


the only laugh that understands,


he holds the keys down


like stopping everything


and the room blooms with madness, and then he stops, stops,


and sits, the candles burning,


one up, one down,


the snow of Italy is all that’s left,


it is over: the essence and the pattern.


I watch as


he pinches out the candles with his fingers, wincing near the outer edge of each eye and the room is dark


as everything has always been.

near a plate glass window






dogs and angels are not


very far apart.


I often go to this little place


to eat


about 2:30 in the afternoon


because all the people who eat


there are completely sane,


glad to be simply alive and


eating their food


near a plate glass window


which welcomes the sun


but doesn’t let the cars and


the sidewalks come inside.


across the street is a Chinese


nudie bar


already open at 2:30 in the


afternoon.


it is painted an


inane and helpless


blue.


we are allowed as many free


coffees as we can drink


and we all sit and quietly drink


the strong black coffee.


it is good to be sitting some place in public at 2:30 in the afternoon without getting the flesh ripped from your bones.






8




nobody bothers us.


we bother nobody.


angels and dogs are not


very far apart


at 2:30 in the afternoon.


I have my favorite table


by the window


and after I have finished


I stack the plates, saucers,


the cup, the silverware, etc.


neatly


in one easy pile—


my offering to the


elderly waitress—


food and time


untorn,


and that bastard sun


out there


working good


all up and


down.

beef tongue






I hadn’t eaten for a couple of days


and I had mentioned that several times and I was up at this poet’s place where a tiny woman took care of him.


he was a big bearded ox with a brain twice as large as the world, and we’d been up all night


listening to tapes, talking, smoking, swallowing pills.


his woman had gone to bed hours ago.


it was 10 a.m.


and the sunlight came on in not caring that we hadn’t slept and the next thing I knew


he was coming out of the kitchen


saying, “hey, Chinaski! LOOK!”


I couldn’t see clearly—


at first it looked like a yellow boot filled with water then it looked like a fish without a head


and then it looked like an elephant’s cock, and then he brought it closer: “beef tongue! beef tongue!”


he held it out at arm’s length


right in my face:


“BEEF TONGUE! BEEF TONGUE!”


and it was, and I never imagined a steer’s tongue was that


fat and long,


it was a rape,


they had gone deep into the creature’s throat and hacked it out, and here it was now: “BEEF TONGUE!”


and it was yellow and pink


and


it was gagging all by itself






10




just another reasonable and sensible atrocity committed by intelligent men. I was not an intelligent man. I


made it to the sink and began to


heave.


stupid, of course, stupid, it was only dead meat,


no feeling now, the pain long since run out of the bottom of the world


but I continued to vomit, finished, cleaned up the sink


and walked back


in. “sorry,” I said.


“it’s o.k., I forgot about your stomach.”


then he walked the tongue back into the kitchen and then came out and we talked of this and that and in about ten minutes


I heard the water boiling and I smelled the tongue cooking in that bubbling water without mouth or eye


or name, it was a huge tongue going around and around


under that lid


and stinking


becoming cooked tongue


becoming most delicious and flavored but since he was an agreeable fellow I asked him please to turn it off.


it was a cold morning and as I shivered in the doorway


as I got ready to leave


the new air was good


I could feel the legs the heart the lungs beginning to envision another chance.








11




we talked about a book of poems he was helping me edit, then I said “goodbye, keep in


touch,” and we didn’t shake hands, a thing neither of us liked to do


and I went up the path and out to my car and started the


engine and as I warmed it up I imagined him moving back into the kitchen behind that mass of black beard,


those blue diamond eyes shining out of all that black hair


those intelligent happy blue diamond eyes knowing everything (almost), and then turning the flame on again


the water beginning to shift and simmer the tongue moving around in there once again.


and I, stupid in my machine, turned away from the curb, let it roll through the yellow morning, down around the curves and dips,


all that green growing nicely along the side of the road.


well,


thank Christ he hadn’t invited me to stay to dinner. when I got home I thumbed through some Renoir, Pissarro and Diaz prints. then I ate a hard-boiled


egg.

the 1930s






places to hunt


places to hide are


getting harder to find, and pet


canaries and goldfish too, did you notice that?


I remember when pool halls were pool halls


not just tables in


bars;


and I remember when neighborhood women used to cook pots of beef stew for their unemployed husbands


when their bellies were sick with


fear;


and I remember when kids used to watch the rain for hours and


would fight to the end over a pet


rat; and


I remember when the boxers were all Jewish and Irish and never gave you a


bad fight; and when the biplanes flew so low you could see the pilot’s face and goggles;


and when one ice cream bar in ten had a free coupon in-


side; and when for 3 cents you could buy enough candy


to make you sick


or last a whole


afternoon; and when the people in the neighborhood raised chickens in their backyards; and when we’d stuff a 5 cent toy auto full of


candle wax to make it last


forever; and when we built our own kites and scooters; and I remember


when our parents fought


13




(you could hear them for blocks)


and they fought for hours, screaming blood-death curses


and the cops never


came.


places to hunt and places to hide,


they’re just not around


anymore. I remember when


each 4th lot was vacant and overgrown, and the landlord


only got his rent


when you had


it, and each day was clear and good and each moment was full of promise.

people as flowers






such singing’s going on in the


streets—


the people look like flowers


at last


the police have turned in their


badges


the army has shredded its uniforms and weapons. there isn’t any need for


jails or newspapers or madhouses or locks on the doors.


a woman rushes through my door.


TAKE ME! LOVE ME!


she screams.


she’s as beautiful as a cigar


after a steak dinner. I


take her.


but after she leaves


I feel odd


I lock the door


go to the desk and take the pistol


from the drawer. it has its own sense of love.


LOVE! LOVE! LOVE! the crowd sings in the streets.


I fire through the window


glass cutting my face and


arms. I get a 12-year-old boy


15




an old man with a beard


and a lovely young girl something like a lilac.


the crowd stops singing to


look at me.


I stand in the broken window


the blood on my


face.


“this,” I yell at them, “is in defense of the poverty of self and in defense of the freedom not to love!”


“leave him alone,” somebody says,


“he is insane, he has lived the bad life for too long.”


I walk into the kitchen


sit down and pour a


glass of whiskey.


I decide that the only definition of


Truth (which changes)


is that it is that thing or act or


belief which the crowd


rejects.


















16




there is a pounding at my


door. it is the same woman again.


she is as beautiful as finding a


fat green frog in the


garden.


I have 2 bullets left and


use them


both.


nothing in the air but


clouds. nothing in the air but


rain. each man’s life too short to


find meaning and


all the books almost a


waste.


I sit and listen to them


singing


I sit and listen to


them.

acceptance






16 years old


during the Depression


I’d come home


and my possessions—


shorts, shirts, stockings,


suitcase and many pages


of short stories—


would be thrown out on the


front lawn and about the


street.


my mother would be


waiting behind a tree:


“Henry, Henry, don’t


go in . . . he’ll


kill you, he’s read


your stories.


please take


this . . . and


find yourself a room.”


but since it worried him


that I might not


finish high school


I’d go back


again.


one evening he walked in


holding


one of my short stories


(which I had never shown


him)


18




and he said, “this is


a great short story!”


and I said, “o.k.,”


and he handed it back to me


and I read it:


and it was a story about


a rich man


who’d had a terrible fight with


his wife and had


gone out into the night


for a cup of coffee


and had sat and studied


the waitress and the spoons


and forks and the


salt and pepper shakers


and the neon sign


in the window


and wondered about it all,


and then he went


to his stable


to see and touch his


favorite horse


who then


for no reason


kicked him in the head


and killed him.


somehow


the story had some


meaning for him


though


when I wrote it


19




I had no idea


what I was


writing about.


so I told him,


“o.k., old man, you can


have it.”


and he took it


and walked out


and closed the door and


I guess that’s


as close


as we ever got.

life at the P.O.






I huddle in front of this maze


of little wooden boxes


poking in small cards and letters


addressed to nonexistent


lives


while the whole town celebrates


and fucks in the street and sings


with the birds.


I stand under a small electric light


and send messages to a dead Garcia,


and I am old enough to die


(I have always been old enough to die) as I stand before this wooden maze and feed its voiceless hunger;


this is my job, my rent, my whore, my shoes, the leeching of the color from my eyes; master, damn you, you’ve found me, my mouth puckered,


my hands shriveled against my


red-spotted sunless chest;


the street is so hard, at least


give me the rest I have paid a life for, and when the Hawk comes I will meet him halfway,


we will embrace where the wallpaper is torn where the rain came in.


now I stand before wood and numbers,


I stand before a graveyard of eyes and mouths of heads hollowed out for shadows, and shadows enter


like mice and look out at me.






21




I poke in cards and letters with secret numbers as agents cut the wires and test my heartbeat, listen for sanity


or cheer or love, and finding none,


satisfied, they leave;


flick, flick, flick, I stand before the wooden maze and my soul faints


and beyond the maze is a window


with sounds, grass, walking, towers, dogs,


but here I stand and here I stay,


sending cards noted with my own demise;


and I am sick with caring: go away, everything, and send fire.

the minute






“I am always fighting for the next


minute,” I tell my wife.


then she begins to tell me


how mistaken I am.


wives have a way of not


believing what their husbands


tell them.


the minute is a very sacred


thing.


I have fought for each one since my


childhood.


I continue to fight for each one.


I have never been bored or


at a loss what to do next.


even when I do nothing,


I am utilizing my time.


why people must go to


amusement parks or movies


or sit in front of tv sets


or work crossword puzzles


or go to picnics


or visit relatives


or travel


or do most of the things


they do


is beyond me.


they mutilate minutes,


hours,


days,


lifetimes.


23




they have no idea of how


precious is a


minute.


I fight to realize the essence


of my time.


this doesn’t mean that


I can’t relax


and take an hour off


but it must be


my choosing.


to fight for each minute is to


fight for what is possible within


yourself,


so that your life and your death


will not be like


theirs.


be not like them


and you will


survive.


minute by


minute.

too near the slaughterhouse






I live too near the slaughterhouse.


what do you expect? silver blood


like Chatterton’s? the dankness of my hours allows no practiced foresight.


I hear the branches snap and break


like ravens in a quarrel,


and see my mother in her coffin


not moving


quietly not moving


as I light a cigarette


or drink a glass of water


or do anything ignominious.


what do you want?


that I should feel


deceived?


(the green of the weeds in


the sun


is all we have


it’s all we really have.)


I say let the monkeys dance,


let the monkeys dance


in the light of God.


I live too near the


slaughterhouse


and am ill


with thriving.

a future congressman






in the men’s room at the


track


this boy of about


7 or 8 years old


came out of a stall


and the man


waiting for him


(probably his


father)


asked,


“what did you do with the


racing program?


I gave it to you


to keep.”


“no,” said the boy,


“I ain’t seen it! I don’t


have it!”


they walked off and


I went into the stall


because it was the only one


available


and there


in the toilet


was the


program.


I tried to flush


the program


away


but it just swam


sluggishly about


26




and


remained.


I got out of


there and found


another


empty stall.


that boy was ready


for his life to come.


he would undoubtedly


be highly successful,


the lying little


prick.

stranger in a strange city






I had just arrived


in another strange city


and I had left my room and


found myself walking along


on what must have been


a main thoroughfare where


the autos ran back and


forth with what seemed to be


* definite purpose.


that busy boulevard seemed to stretch away endless


before me and appeared to run straight off to the edge of the earth,


and then


after walking awhile I realized


that I was lost, that


I had forgotten the name of the street my


room was on or


where it was.


there was nothing back


in that room


but a week’s paid


rent


plus a battered


28




suitcase


full of my old clothes


but it was


everything I


possessed


so I began searching


the side streets


looking for


my room


and I soon became


frightened, a


numb terror like a fatal


illness


spreading through me


as


I kept walking


up and down unfamiliar


streets


until my mind


said to me:


you’re crazy, that’s


all, you should


give up and turn


yourself in


somewhere.


but I just kept walking.


it had been a


long afternoon and now


it was slipping


into evening.


29




my feet ached


in my cheap


shoes.


then it grew


dark, now it was night,


but I just kept


walking.


it felt as if


I had walked


up and down through


the same streets


over and over.


then finally


I recognized my


building!


and I ran


up the steps


and up the interior


stairway to


the 2nd floor


and my room was still


there and I


opened the door,


closed it behind me,


and was


safely inside.


there was the


suitcase


30




on the floor,


still full of my


old clothing.


I heard a man


laugh


in one of the other


rooms and I suddenly


felt a lot


better.


I took off my shoes,


shirt, pants,


sat down on the edge


of the bed and


rolled a


cigarette.


then I leaned back against


the pillow and


smoked.


I was 20 years old


and had 14 dollars


in my wallet.


then I remembered


my wine bottle.


I pulled it out


from under the


bed, uncapped it


and had a good


hit.


31




I decided that I


wasn’t crazy.


I picked a newspaper up


off the floor


and turned to the


HELP WANTED section:


dishwasher, shipping


clerk, stock boy,


night watchman . . .


I threw the paper down


on the floor.


I’d look for a


job


day after


tomorrow.


then I put the


cigarette out


satisfied


and went to


sleep.


























32
just another wino






the kid was 20, had been on the road 5 or 6 years and he sat on the couch drinking my beer, his name was Red, and he talked about the road:


“these 2 guys were trying to treat me


nice, keep me quiet, because I’d seen them kill a guy.”


“kill a guy? how?”


“with a rock.”


“what for?”


“he had his wallet, a good


wallet, and 7 dollars. he was a wino. he was drunk and they hit him with the rock, knocked out his brains.” “you saw it?”


“I saw it. the next time the train stopped


they dumped him out, they dumped him in some high grass. then the train started up again.”


I gave the kid another beer.


“when the police find those guys in rags, no identification, wine-faced, they say ‘just another wino,’ they don’t even follow up, they just forget it.”


we talked most of the night


about the road. I told him a few stories of my own. then I went to bed. he slept on the


couch. I went into the bedroom with the woman and kid. slept.








33




when I got up to piss in the morning Red was sitting in a chair reading yesterday’s paper.


“I gotta go,” he said, “I can’t sleep anymore, but I had a good night, some good talk. thanks.”


“me too, Red. easy now.”


“sure.”


then he was out the door and down the street, gone.


back in the bedroom she asked, “is Red gone?”


“yeah.”


“where’d he go?”


“I don’t know. Texas. Hell. Boston. anywhere.”


the little girl woke


up: “I wanna bottle!”


“can you get her a bottle? you’re up.” “sure.”


I went into the kitchen and mixed some


milk. and everywhere things were working out there, cruel and not cruel, spiders and bums


and soldiers and gamblers and madmen and factotums and fags and firemen, like that,
and I went back in and handed the girl the bottle got back into bed


and listened to the kid sucking on the thing— suck suck suck,


and soon we’d have our own


breakfast.






34
it is not much






I suppose like others


I have come through fire and sword,


love gone wrong,


head-on crashes, drunk at sea,


and I have listened to the simple sound of water running in tubs


and wished to drown


but simply couldn’t bear the others


carrying my body down three flights of stairs to the round mouths of curious biddies; the psyche has been burned


and left us senseless,


the world has been darker than lights-out in a closet full of hungry bats,


and the whiskey and wine entered our veins when blood was too weak to carry on; and it will happen to others,


and our few good times will be rare


because we have a critical sense


and are not easy to fool with laughter; small gnats crawl our screen but we see through


to a wasted landscape


and let them have their moment;


we only asked for leopards to guard


our thinning dreams.


I once lay in a


white hospital


for the dying and the dying


self, where some god pissed a rain of reason to make things grow only to die, where on my knees


35




I prayed for LIGHT,


I prayed for l*i*g*h*t,


and praying


crawled like a blind slug into the


web


where threads of wind stuck against my mind


and I died of pity


for Man, for myself,


on a cross without nails,


watching in fear as


the pig belches in his sty, farts,


blinks and eats.






























































36
the bull






I did not know


that the Mexicans


did this:


the bull


had been brave


and now


they dragged him


dead


around the ring


by his


tail,


a brave bull


dead,


but not just any bull,


this was a special


bull,


and to me


a special


lesson learned . . .


and although Brahms


stole his First from Beethoven’s


9th


and although


the bull


was dead,


his head and his horns and his intestines dead,


he had been better than


Brahms,


as good as


Beethoven,






37




and


as we walked out


the sound and meaning


of him


kept crawling up my arms


and although people jostled me and stepped on my toes


the bull burned within me


my candle of


light;


dragged by his tail


he had nothing to do with anything now having escaped it all,


and down through the long tunnel, surrounded by elbows and feet and eyes, I prayed for Tijuana and for the dead bull


and man


and me,


the blue kissing waters


enjoying the knot of pain,


and I clenched my hands


deep within my


pockets, seized darkness


and moved on.


























38
the people, no






startling! such determination in the


dull and uninspired


and the copyists.


they never lose the fierce gratitude


for their uneventfulness,


nor do they forget to laugh


at the wit of slugs;


as a study in diluted senses


they’d make any pharaoh


cough up his beans;


in music they prefer the monotony of dripping faucets;


in love and sex they prefer each other and therefore compound the problem;


the energy with which they propel their uselessness


(without any self-doubt)


toward worthless goals


is as magnificent as


cow shit.


they produce novels, children, death,


freeways, cities, wars, wealth, poverty, politicians and total areas of grandiose waste;


it’s as if the whole world is wrapped in dirty bandages.


it’s best to take walks late at


night.


it’s best to do your business only on


Mondays and


Tuesdays.


39




it’s best to sit in a small room


with the shades down


and


wait.


the strongest men are the fewest


and the strongest women die alone


too.

you might as well kiss your ass goodbye






I finally met him. he sat in an old robe and bitched for 5 hours.


“look,” he said, “don’t trust Krause,


Krause will rob you. he owes me 10,000 dollars and there’s no way I can get it out of him. a real bastard.”


“Sir,” I said, “when you wrote that first novel,


it was so humorous, the truth is always so funny,


you know, the way people act, like blind mechanical things, killing without reason, marvelous how you got it all down.”


an old woman came in and set a pot of tea in front of


him. “they smashed my motorcycle, stole my manuscripts, cleaned me out. they would have killed me but I wasn’t here. they called me a fascist, claimed I sold the plans
to the Maginot Line to the Krauts. now where the hell would I ever


get the plans to the Maginot


Line?”


he poured his tea. lifted the cup. it was too hot or something. he spit it out on the rug, some of it on my shoes and pants.


“Sir,” I asked, “that first novel, did you really eat your own flesh as a young writer? were you that


hungry? by god, that was some novel, I’ll never forget it!”


“Martha!” he called. “Martha!”






41




the old woman came in.


“you forgot the lemon and sugar, you old hag!”


the old woman ran out


for the lemon and sugar.


“the government claims I owe them 70,000 dollars! they don’t bother Krause. the son-of-


a-bitch rides around in a Cadillac and owns a twelve


acre estate. don’t ever trust Krause. he’s a bloodsucker. he’s sucked the bodies and talents of at least 3 dozen writers dry. he’s like a giant spider, a tarantula!”


“Krause has never asked me for anything . . .”


“if he does, you might as well kiss your ass goodbye!”


Martha ran in with the lemon and sugar.


“you damned washed-up whore! I oughta whip your ass!”


“Sir,” I said, “you’re looked up to


as one of the strongest writers since 1900.”


“don’t trust Krause! a bloodsucker!”


he bitched for 5 hours. and I listened. then his head fell back, across the top of his rocker, and I saw that


famous hawk profile. then he began to snore.


42




he was just an old man in an old


bathrobe.


I stood up. Martha came in.


“I’m glad I had a chance to meet him,” I told her.


“I try to remember he was once a great writer,” she told me.


“he’s still kind of humorous,”


I told her.


“I don’t think so,” she said,


“you see, I’m his


wife.”


“goodnight,” I


said.


“goodnight,” she


replied.






























43
purple glow






I see the high-heeled


shoes and a dried white rose


lying on the bar


like a clenched


fist.


whiskey makes the heart beat faster but it sure doesn’t help the


mind and isn’t it funny how you can ache just from the deadly drone of existence?




I see this


nudie dancer running along the top of the bar


shaking what she thinks is


magic


with all those faces staring


up from overpriced


drinks.


and me? being there? no shit,


I really didn’t care about


her but I love the pulse of


the loud flat music thumping


in the purple glow, some-


thing about it all: I hardly


ever felt better.


I watch her, the purple


doll so


sad so cheap so


sad, you would never want to


44




bed down with her or even hear her speak, yet in that drunken place you would


like to hand your heart to her


and say


touch it


but then


give it back.


she dances so fiercely now in


the purple glow,


purple does something strange to me:


there was a night


30 years ago


I was drunk, true, and there was


a purple Christ in a glass box


outside a little church and I


smashed the glass, I broke


the glass, and then I reached in and touched Christ but


He was only a dummy and I heard the sirens then and started running.




well, my mind has never been the same since and the typing helps but you can’t type all the time, so the nudie dancer now breaks what heart I have left and I


don’t know why but I start giving money to everybody in the bar, I give a five to this guy, a ten to that, I think maybe it might


45




wake them to the wisdom


of it all


but they don’t even say


“thanks,” they just think I’m a


fool.


the manager comes up and tells me


I’m 86’d, I hand him a


twenty, he takes


it.


two friends


have been sitting at a back


table, they help me up and out of the bar.


I think the situation is very


funny but they are


angry:


where’s your car?


where’s your fucking


car?


I say, I


dunno.


too fucking bad, they


say and


leave me sitting alone on an


apartment house


step.


46




I light up and smoke a cigarette,


then get up and begin the long


walk, a walk I know will


entail at least a couple of


hours


to find my car (past experience)


but I know that when I


find it, the rush of


happiness will be


all I need


and that I will then be able to


begin my life all over


again.




























































47
one thousand dollars






all of my knowledge about horse racing told me that this was a sure bet. I bet one thousand to win.


the horse had post one


at 6 furlongs.


the bell rang and they came


out of the gate.


my horse turned left


ran through the fence


fell down and


died


right there


at 7/5.


when I tell people this story


they don’t say


anything.


sometimes there’s nothing to say


about


death.






























48
grip the dark






I sit here


drunk now


listening to the


same symphonies


that gave me


the will to go on


when I was 22.


40 years later


they and I are not quite so


magical.


you should have


seen me then


so


lean


no


gut


I was


a gaunt string of a


man:


blazing, strong,


insane.


say one wrong


word


to me


and I’d crack you right


there.


I didn’t want to be


bothered with


49




anything or


anyone.


I seemed to be


always on my way to some


cell


after being booked for


doing things


on or off the


avenue.


I sit here


drunk now.


I am


a series of


small victories


and large defeats


and I am as


amazed


as any other


that


I have gotten


from there to


here


without committing murder


or being


murdered;


without


having ended up in the


madhouse.








50




as I drink alone


again tonight


my soul despite all the past


agony


thanks all the gods


who were not


there


for me


then.








































































51
the dwarf with a punch






this is many years later


and I still can’t figure it out


but it was in New York


and New York has its own rules and anyhow, I am sitting around in one of those places


with many round tables


with their tough and terrible knights; me, I don’t feel so good, as usual, neither tough nor terrible, just rotten,


and I am sitting with some woman with some kind of hood over her head, she is half crazy


but that doesn’t matter.


she has a name, Fay,


I think it was,


and we have been drinking, going from place to place, and we went in there, and it seemed terribly


lively


because there was a dwarf about 3


feet tall


and the dwarf was walking around drunk


and he’d stop at a table


and look at a man


and say,


“well, what YOU got to say?”


and then the dwarf would crush him one in the mouth, only the dwarf had very good hands and one hell of a punch.


52




then everybody would laugh and the dwarf would go to the bar


for another drink.


“keep him away from me, Fay!” I told her.


“uh? whatzat? what? who?”


“keep him away from me!”


“what? waz? away?”


the dwarf unloaded on another guy


and everybody laughed,


even I laughed. that dwarf could punch.


he had a lot of


practice.


he danced to the bar


doing a little soft shoe


then he noticed a sailor


very blond and young and


scared.


the kid pissed in his pants


and smiled at the


dwarf.


the dwarf chopped him a


good one;


his next smile was a


bit bloody.


then the dwarf put another on his chin knocking the sailor over backward in his


chair, out


cold.


k.o.! all hail the


champion!


then the dwarf saw


53




me. the man at the table in


back.


“keep him away from me, Fay!”


I said.


“lez have another drink!” she said.


(she had a full drink in front of her.)


he came up to me


in all 3 feet of his


glory.


“well, what YOU got to say?”


I didn’t answer. I didn’t have anything to say that he would understand. “nothing, hah?”


I nodded. it came. I felt my chair rock, then


settle again on its legs. shots of red and yellow and blue light followed, then laughter. sitting there


I swung back.


his poor 3 feet slid along the floor like a rag doll


and then they were down on me


it seemed like a dozen men


(but it might have been 3 or 4)


and I caught some more


good ones.


then I was thrown outside,


I got up


and found a hanky


and tried to stop


the worst of the blood


and Fay was there,






54




“you coward, you hit that little


man!”


I walked down the street


but she was right there with me


and we went into the next place


and I looked around


and seeing that everyone was more than 4 feet tall,


I ordered 2 more


drinks.




































































55
the elephants of Vietnam






first they used to, he told me,


gun and bomb the elephants,


you could hear their screams over all the other sounds; but you flew high to bomb the people, you never saw it,


just a little flash from way up


but with the elephants


you could watch it happen


and hear how they screamed;


I’d tell my buddies, listen, you guys stop that,


but they just laughed


as the elephants scattered


throwing up their trunks (if they weren’t blown off)


opening their mouths


wide and


kicking their dumb clumsy legs


as blood ran out of big holes in their bellies.


then we’d fly back,


mission completed.


we’d get everything:


convoys, dumps, bridges, people, elephants and all the rest.


he told me later, I


felt bad about the


elephants.














56
breakfast






waking up on those mornings in the drunk tank, busted lower lip, loose teeth, brains swimming in a cacophony not yours, with


all those strange others swathed in rags, noisy now in their mad sleep, with nothing for company but a stopped-up toilet, a cold hard floor


and somebody else’s


law.


and there was always one early voice, a loud voice:


“BREAKFAST!”


you usually didn’t want it


but if you did


before you could gather your thoughts and scramble to your feet the cell door was slammed


shut.


now each morning it’s like a slow contented dream, I find my slippers, put them on,
do the bathroom bit, then walk down the stairway in a swirl of furry bodies, I am


the feeder, the god, I clean the cat bowls, open


the cans and talk to them and they get excited and make their anxious sounds.


I put the bowls down as each cat moves to its own bowl, then I refill the water dish and watch all five of them eating peacefully.






57




I walk back up the stairway to the bedroom where my wife is still asleep, I crawl beneath the sheets with her, place my back to the sun and am soon asleep again.


you have to die a few times before you can really live.
















































































58
inverted love song






I could scream down 90 mountains


to less than dust


if only one living human had eyes in the head


and heart in the body,


but there is no chance,


my god,


no chance.


rat with rat dog with dog hog with hog, play the piano drunk listen to the drunk piano,


realize the myth of mercy


stand still


as even a child’s voice snarls


and we have not been fooled,


it was only that we wanted to believe.

Salty Dogs






got to the track early to study the odds and here’s this man coming by


dusting seats. he keeps at his work, dusting, most probably glad to have his simple job.


I’m one of those who doesn’t think there is much difference between an atomic scientist and a man who cleans the seats except for the luck of the draw—


parents with enough money to point you safely toward a more generous life.


“how’s it going?” I asked him as he dusted by.


“o.k., how about you?” he asked.


“I do all right with the horses. it’s with the women I lose.”


he laughed. “yeah. a man has two or three bad experiences, it really sets him back.”


“I don’t mind two or three,” I told him, “I mind eleven or twelve.”


“man, you must know something by now. who do you like in the first?”


I told him that Salty Dog was reading 4-to-1 and should


finish one-two. (45 minutes later it did.) but it wasn’t 45


minutes later yet. the man went on dusting and I thought of all my


rotten jobs and how glad I was to have them. for a


while. then it was a matter of quitting or getting fired.


both felt good.






60




it’s when you live with one woman for more than two


years you know what’s bound to happen only you don’t know exactly why. it’s not in the chart. it’s in past performance, not in the chart.


my friend, dusting the seats, he didn’t know exactly why either.


I walked over for a coffee. the slim girl behind the counter was a brunette with a tiny blue flower in her hair, nice eyes, nice smile. I paid for my coffee.


“good luck,” she said.


“you too,” I said.


I took the coffee to my seat, the wind came up from the west, I took a sip and waited for the action, thinking of


many things, too many things. the scene dissolved into grass and trees and the dirt track and I remembered dirty shades in dirty rooming houses flapping back and forth in a light wind, and I thought about dirty troops plundering some new village, and about my old girlfriends unhappy again with their new men.


I sat and drank my coffee and waited for the first race.
























61
brainless eyes






in the bitter morning


high roses grow


and the frogs celebrate


victory.


in the empty balloon of night


nothing grows;


the night


gnaws and belches


and victory is celebrated only


by indecent ladies


with spread legs


and brainless eyes.


at noon,


say at noon,


something happens


finally.


the signal changes


the traffic moves through.


life itself is not the miracle.


that pain should be so constant,


that’s the miracle—


that hammer of the thing


when you can’t even scream or weep and it sits all over you looking into your eyes


eating your flesh.








62




morning night and noon


the traffic moves through


and the murder and treachery


of friends and lovers


and all the people


move through you.


pain is the joy of knowing


the unkindest truth


that arrives without


warning.


life is being alone


death is being alone.


even the fools weep


morning night and noon.












































63
unbelievable






I’ve been going to the track for


decades


but I saw something new


today.


2 horses threw their riders.


usually when a horse throws


his or her rider


he (or she) continues to run


in the same direction as


the other horses.


but


this time


both horses turned


and began to run in the


opposite direction,


in other words,


toward the oncoming


field.


it was a 5/8ths mile


track


and they were


approaching one another


pretty fast.


the announcer warned


the riders


and as they came


around the last curve


and into the stretch


here came the other


2 horses right at


them.






64




there was no screaming.


there was a dead


silence.


you could hear the hooves


pounding the dirt.


then one horse swung


wide


and went outside the


field.


the other headed straight


into it


and passed right through


between the other


horses.


the other horses reached


the wire.


mine had won.


but the judges held an


inquiry and it was


declared


no contest.


I didn’t give a


damn.














65




I kept seeing that horse


rushing at the field


and passing right through,


untouched.


a miracle.
















































































66
war and peace






to experience


real agony


is


something


hard


to write about,


impossible


to understand


while it


grips you;


you’re


frightened


out of


your


wits,


can’t sit


still,


move


or even


go


decently


insane.


and then


when your


composure


finally


returns


and you are


able to


evaluate


the


67




experience


it’s almost as


if it


had happened


to


somebody


else


because


look at


you


now:


calm


detached


say


cleaning your


fingernails


looking through


a


drawer


for


stamps


applying


polish


to your


shoes






68




or


paying the


electric


bill.


life is


and is not


a


gentle


bore.




































































69
the harder you try






the waste of words


continues with a stunning


persistence


as the waiter runs by carrying the loaded tray


for all the wise white boys who laugh at us.


no matter. no matter,


as long as your shoes are tied and


nobody is walking too close


behind.


just being able to scratch yourself and be nonchalant is victory enough.


those constipated minds that seek


larger meaning


will be dispatched with the other


garbage.


back off.


if there is light


it will find


you.
































70














two
  

















beware women grown


old


who were never


anything but


young.


all the little girls






it was up in northern California


and he stood in the pulpit


and he had been reading for some time he had been reading many poems about Mother Nature and the inherent goodness of man.


he believed that everything was


all right with the world.


and you couldn’t blame him:


he was a tenured professor who had never been in jail or in a whorehouse; who had never had his used car die


on the freeway; who


had never needed more than


three drinks during his wildest


evening;


who had never been rolled, flogged or mugged;


who had never been bitten by a dog;


who got regular gracious letters from Gary Snyder, and whose face was kindly, unmarked and


tender. finally,


his wife had never betrayed him,


nor had his luck.


he said, “I’m just going to read


three more poems and then I’m going to step down from here and let Chinaski read.”






73




“oh no,” said all the


little girls in their pink and blue and white and orange and lavender dresses. “oh no,


read some more, read some


more!”


he read one more poem and then he said, “this is the last poem that I will read.”


“oh no,” said all the little


girls in their red and green see-


through dresses. “oh no,” said


all the little girls in their tight blue


jeans with little sewn hearts on them.


“oh no,” said all the little girls,


“please read


more poems!”


but he was as good as his word.


he got the poem out and he got down and vanished somewhere. as I got up to read the little girls wiggled in


their seats and one of them hissed and


some of them made interesting remarks to me which I will use in a poem at some later date because this particular goddamned poem has to end somewhere.












74




anyway, it was two or three weeks later when I got this letter from the poet William saying that he did enjoy my reading. he was a true gentleman.


I was in bed with a


three-day hangover. I lost the envelope


but I took the letter and folded it


into one of those paper airplanes


I had learned to make in grammar


school. it sailed around the room


and landed between an old Racing Form and a pair of well-worn shorts.


we have not corresponded since.
























































75
no more of those young men






my first husband, Retzel, she said, flew gliders. he had only one hand. he never went down on me even once. he wants to meet you, he lives in Redondo Beach.


Redondo Beach, I said, Redondo Beach.


my next husband,


Craft, took pills and played the piano all day.


then he had to have one of his fingers operated on.


a wart. he was cruel to me. he knows now


how cruel he was to me.


where is he now?


Africa. he’s still in Africa.


I hitched all over Africa. I bummed down there on a boat. I met a man with a


leopard. he used to take his leopard for a walk every day on a chain.


one day he didn’t show up. his leopard had eaten him.


that’s a funny story.


I think so too. I like you. you understand things. no more of those young men for me, those hard bodies. I want you. you’re in control of everything.








76




I am?


yes, my next husband,


Larry, once covered my body with rose petals. all those flowers! it was lovely but he didn’t make love to me again for 2 years. he was such a bad lover. you’re a great lover.




I am?


yes, wouldn’t you like to go to Holland?


no.


to Paris?


no.


to Africa?


no.


Redondo Beach?


no.


you’re strange. don’t you like to


travel?








77




I’m sick of that.


you should have seen me fly Retzel’s glider!


I was good on that glider.


but he would never go down on


me.


Retzel?


yes, he’s a publicist now. he makes good money.


some day I’ll tell you about my


wives.


I don’t want to hear about your


wives. I don’t want to hear about


any of


them.


she turned over in bed


giving me her back and her


behind.


kid, I said, tell me more about


Retzel.


she turned back toward


me. you really want to


hear?








78




sure.


then we lay there on our backs


and she talked about Retzel


and I listened.




















































































79
legs






she arrived in a taxi


completely intoxicated.


it was


after one of my long days as


a May Co. stock boy


and I sat there


exhausted and


sucking at


my beer and


looking at her


in her rumpled state


spread across the bed


skirt hiked high.


I sucked at my drink


then walked over


to the bed and lifted


her skirt higher:


such a sight


those glorious legs


uncovered and helpless.


she was a great woman with


great legs.


we had such tremendous fun


and much agony together


for some years














80




but she found


life too hard;


she died


34 years ago and


I haven’t seen


legs like that


since


and I have


never stopped


looking.






























































81
Jane’s shoes






my shoes in the closet like forgotten lilies,


my shoes alone right now,


like dogs walking dead avenues,


and I got a letter from a


woman in a hospital,


love, she says, love,


but I do not write back,


I do not understand myself,


she sends me photographs of


herself


taken in the hospital


and I remember her on other


nights,


not dying,


her shoes with heels like daggers


sitting next to mine


in the closet;


how those strong nights


lied to us,


how those nights became quiet


finally,


my shoes alone in the closet now


flown over by coats and


awkward shirts,


and I look into the hole the


door leaves


and the walls, and I do not


write


back.








82
Rimbaud be damned






it was in Santa Fe.


we sat up waiting for her.


she had gone to some art show or some other goddamned silly useless thing.


she was a good artist


better than many men


and that was the


problem.


“what the hell happened to Helen?”


“where’s Helen?”


Helen’s husband, x-husband, was now sitting on the top of a hill somewhere with a new blue-eyed whore. quite a


whore: she even wrote


poetry. Vicki was her name. Vicki was now “Mrs.” she had exchanged a rich husband for an even richer one.


“Helen asked me not to hate Vicki,” said my hostess, “but hell, I can’t even like Vicki.”


“hell,” said my host, “can’t you


try?”


“do you like Vicki?” asked my hostess.


Vicki had looked good to me. I couldn’t find anything wrong with her.






83




“where’s Helen?” I asked again. “oh where oh where the hell is Helen?”


“she’ll be here, she’ll be here, she said she was coming.”


Helen showed up 3 hours later.


she looked like a snake in a green dress, all fluid, wild wild, glazed,


her silver necklace pulsating


on her throat


right under my nose.


she was consumed by 3 simple things: drink, despair, loneliness; and 2 more: youth and beauty.


it was too much:


I could not withstand the force of


her. I kissed her. I kissed her


again. I was like a schoolboy,


all my toughness


gone.


“let’s get the hell out of here!”


I told her, ignoring our host and hostess.


we went next door to her place


and I sat in her kitchen drinking and


watching


her.








84




“your body, your body, Jesus!” I told her. she was truly beautiful and laughing, just like you read about in a novel only it never really happens to


anybody.


she twisted her body and while humming did a lovely dance filled with innuendo.


“baby, I love you,” I said, “baby, I love you!”


we walked down a dark hall hung with a crucifix and some of her paintings. we entered another large room. I hung on to my drink.


“stay here,” she said.


I sat on a couch and drank. it seemed cold and hollow suddenly and I wondered where she had


gone.


then I looked around and she was lying on another couch


naked and smiling


which was unsettling


for I am used to undressing my


women








85




and the look of her stark naked there reminded me more of


my slaughterhouse days than


it did of Mozart,


but, of course, who wants to fuck


Mozart?


I finished my drink and undressed and I tried but I guess I was not much it was my fault


my fault


and she shoved me


away.


I made a few more halfhearted


tries and then she got up and left.


I also dressed and then


I don’t remember much else except


being pretty drunk.


but then when she shoved me out into the rain I revived.


the rain was wet the rain was cold the rain was freezing.


“shit,” I said, “shit!” I ran back to her door or to the door I thought was her door but there seemed to be dozens of doors, a series of apartments all


enjoined.






86




I beat on the door I hoped was hers:


“baby, baby, I don’t want to fuck you! I realize that I am a lousy lover! all I want is to get out of this goddamned rain!”


she didn’t reply. I gave up. I ran back to


my first host’s apartment. I beat on his door.


it didn’t work. the rain was like ice.


I looked into an open garage but it was filled with mud and water; no place to lie down.


“let me in!” I screamed. “Jesus! mercy! what have I done?


what have I failed to do? YOU ARE YOUR BROTHER’S KEEPER!”


my host came to the door:


“you are a dirty dog!”


“I know, but let me in,


please.”


he opened the door and I followed him down the hall.


“boy oh boy,” he said, “you are a son-of-a-bitch, you are a yellow hound, you aren’t worth a damn!”


“I know it,” I said.


“did you tell her that I was an x-con?”


“hell, no, I wasn’t even thinking of


you.”


87




“then what the hell do you want from me?”


“nothing. you paid the


train fare down.”


“you insulted us both. I don’t care about myself but you can’t insult my wife. you said to Helen, ‘let’s you and I get the hell out of here, these other people are nothing!’ ”


“fuck that. you got any whiskey


left?”


“in the refrigerator.”


“thanks.”


he grunted and climbed into bed beside his wife.


I brought the bottle out to my cot


and nipped nipped nipped and


listened to the


rain. I thought the night was


over but then he began


again:


“I thought you were a great writer


I thought you were a great man


that’s why I paid your fare down here


that’s why I published your poetry






88




that’s why I wanted all these people to meet you!”


“all right,” I said, gulping the good whiskey, “I’ll leave in the morning. why don’t we all go to sleep?”


“you are really a son-of-a-bitch!


I never thought you’d be such a son-of-a-bitch! why do you always keep your eyes half closed? why can’t you look a man in the face? why do you always avert your glance?”


“I dunno, I dunno.”


“you’re yellow, that’s all: YELLOW!”


I knew it was true


and I took a big hit of whiskey and


said:


“ya wanna go outside and fight?”


“hell! you’ve got ten years on me!”


“I’ll give ya the first


punch!”


“you promise you’ll leave in the morning?”


“sure.”


.•        •        •




89




Helen heard about me leaving


from them I guess


and she came down a little early the next morning to ask if she could drive me to the little hotel to catch the bus to the train station.


she still looked good


even more than before


dressed in tight pants and Indian moccasins and when nobody was looking


I reached over and pinched her


foot. she ignored it but did not tell me to go to hell


so I felt all warm


inside.


“o.k., I’ll drive him down,” she said to my hosts.


“thanks,” they said.


I went in to take a


shit.


“we hate to see him go,” I heard


my hosts say.


“so do I,” she


said.


a big turd dropped


out.


90




“I’ll be back at 2 to pick him up,”


she said.


“goodbye.”


“goodbye.”


when I came out there were 2 Indians sitting there with my hosts.


the Chief said, “I trusted that nigger with 8 bucks for 2 four-pound sacks of chili beans. it’s been 2
weeks and he ain’t back yet. he worked for some cement company. lemme have your phone book, I’m gonna find that bastard!”


they introduced me to his squaw. I kissed her on the cheek. she giggled. she was about 60 years old and had bad legs.


“I got problems,” said the Chief, and then he ripped the blanket off my cot
and wrapped it around and around himself.


“I am big Chief,” he said, “all I need is a


good piece of ass and then to catch that nigger.”


“don’t look at me,” I told him, “I am neither.”


the Chief looked at


me. “I think I need a bath,”


he said.






91




he went and climbed into one of the 3 tubs in one of the


3 bathrooms. then the squaw decided that she also needed a bath. and then somebody else decided they had to take a shit. they all vanished. I drank my drink and went back to sleep.


.•        •        •


“we are so sorry to see you go,” a


voice said, waking me.


the Indians had left.


“it’s all right,” I


said.


I didn’t get any


argument.


I got into the car with Helen and the sight


of her nylon knees beat hammers into my brain.


I was so sorry that I would never possess anything good, anything like her,


that nothing good would ever belong to me not because I was always poor in dollars
but because I was poor at expressing myself one-on-one. I was as yellow as the sun perhaps


but also as warm and as true as the sun somewhere there inside me but nobody would ever find it.


I would certainly end up forever crying the blues into a coffee cup in a park for old men playing


92




chess or silly games of some sort.


shit! shit!


and then Helen shifted the gears and we rolled down through the rich hills and there was nothing I could say to her about her beauty or how tough I was


or that just to sit and look at her for a month never to touch her again would be my only desire


but like a bastard I was probably lying to myself I probably wanted everything everything but now at 45


having lived with a dozen women and loving none I was now crazy, finished. as she


drove me through the hills everything screamed inside of me, and I kept saying as we drove along (to myself, of course)


fucker, it will pass,


everything passes,


it’s all a joke


a joke on you,


forget it, think of dead dogs dead things think of


yourself: unwanted, broke, simple, a supposed poet writing of deep things, but you can’t really write about anything except YOURSELF. isn’t it true? isn’t it true? you are a prick,
a self-centered jackass only wanting an easy way out? you crave money, grandstands full of applause, recognition and a book of poems that will still be admired in the year 2,179.


you are a


shit-yellow screaming jackal: you ain’t gonna make it and


you might as well get used to it


now.


93




we drove up to the little hotel


and the poor jackass poet said,


“may I say goodbye?” it was


like a bad movie, only it wasn’t a movie:


I could understand Dos’s Crime and Punishment


I could understand the moon leaning across a bar on skid row and asking for a drink, but I couldn’t understand anything about


myself,


I was murdered, I was shit, I was a tentful of dogs,


* was poppies mowed down by machine-gun fire


* was a hotshot wasp in a web


* was less and less and still reaching for something, and I thought of her corny remark a night or so ago:


“you have wounded eyes.”


corny, of course, but anything that comes from a real woman is not corny


and I thought of her decent paintings of people and things reaching wanting wanting


and like a shell-shocked Jap surrounded by heroic American troops


* kissed her


goodbye.


“I’m sorry I couldn’t make it good for you,” she said. “I wasn’t ready, I guess.” “no, it was my fault,”


I told her.


I walked into the little hotel in that


small town (from where they took you to the train via bus) and I got lost, shit, I got lost,


94




I couldn’t find the ticket office, up and down steps


in and out of doors


tears again finally


like a bad movie again, and


finally I found the ticket agent


and went through the business


of buying a ticket.


I went and sat in the lobby and


I looked up from my ticket


and there she was.


“what are you doing here?” I asked.


“I saw you all hunched up and sad and cold.


I kept thinking of you.”


the bus to the train was late, everything was


late, so she drove me around town meanwhile and I had to go through the whole thing again with her.


and I knew that even the proper words would never do the trick. I was dirty, dirt, I looked like dirt,


I was dirty, dirty dirt. I just wanted to get inside of her, stay there, I was nothing but a cunt-wanter and


I was broke. I couldn’t spell, I didn’t even know about using


2 or 3 forks at dinner, I didn’t know anything about Harvard or diplomas or 50 grand a year, and she knew that all that


was true: I had been kicked around for too long, I no longer


knew the way up or out or even wanted to know: I was destined for failure.






95




I said goodbye again


sucking up all that was left of her into the little that was left of


me. I said, “don’t look for me again. fuck it.


we are all lost. goodbye, goodbye.”


she was great. she drove off. I watched that last flash of her go around the corner and disappear and then I walked back into the hotel lobby.


they were chummy, 5 or 6 assholes still sitting and waiting there.


2 were doctors. another was the possessor of something great and important. they all had wives. it was beginning to snow.


we all climbed into the bus to go to the train. I was already numb, numb again,


numb


again


again and again,


numbness and pain swelling in


me—just like in the good


old times.


the Mexican drove down the road and almost stripped the gears.












96




the comfortable people made comfortable jokes about weather and things but I sat mostly silent


saying a word or so when necessary


a word or so


trying to hide from them the fact that I was a fool and feeling terrible


and the small hills began to be covered with snow slowly things became white slowly things became whiter


and I knew that it all would finally pass and thank the good grace of the good God, my years and time were running out; we drove on and on,


past little villages and both good things and bad things were happening to the people in those villages too,


but I still was nothing


but arms and ears and eyes and maybe there’d be either some good luck for me or more death tomorrow.




































97
bewitched in New York






the lady was the most unfaithful and terrible I had


ever encountered and I knew it and she knew it and she was both ugly and beautiful at the same time and the


two of her just sat there on the window ledge of that open hotel window in New York City on


one of the hottest days of all time, no air-conditioning, no fan, we sweated and suffered and waited for something to happen.


I was drunk, she was on drugs, we had just concluded a slippery bit of


copulation and afterward she said, “you son-of-a-bitch, we’re stuck here in hell!”


“good,” I said.


then I saw her fall out of the window, we were four floors up, I heard the scream, her body was gone.


then it was back, she was sitting on the window ledge again. “did you see that?” she asked. “I fell out of the window!”


“good,” I said.


“but somehow I pulled myself back in!” she said.


“good,” I said.


98




“is that all you can say?” she asked.


“ ‘good’?”


“I can say that I think you’re a witch or a devil and that your window act just now proves it.”


I felt that by falling out she had lifted my spirits and then she had deliberately dashed them by climbing back in.




“so I’m a witch or a devil, huh? well, no more ass for you!”


“good,” I said.


sometimes you live and stay with a woman and have no real idea why.


with her I knew: it was the simple, fascinating, unrelenting mystery and terror of her self.






























99
don’t worry, baby, I’ll get it






he saw her in a liquor store


and it shook him


shook shook shook


like shark meat alive still in sunlight flopping.


he hurled his eyes at her,


a miracle, he heard her talking to him,


she was funny, she made him laugh, she made him feel like all the doors were open for him.


it was easy. she went back to his place with him.


they talked. it was easy. she was a glorious fuck. they


fucked 3 times. she


stayed.


“Smaltz,” they phoned him from work the next day, “what ya doin’, ya didn’t come


in! we got the Granger-Wently order to get out: 45 six-foot squeegees and 90 gallons of ultramarine Day-Glo!”


“I’m busy,” he said, and they replied, “we can get a shipping clerk


anywhere!” he hung up, turned her over and


fucked her


again.


it wasn’t the same as with the others:


every time he finished he felt he wanted more.


as she took the trip to the bathroom it seemed as if he hadn’t yet really had her, and anything she put on,




100




a newspaper hat, a pair of his socks, she looked glorious, funny funny, hell, she made him feel good, everything she said, shit, was a


joke. she’d put that body up against his every morning and say, “ah, don’t go ta work, Eddie baby, stay wit me!”


“I can’t go to work, sweets, I don’t have no job,” he’d say,


and they’d go at it


again.


so the day came: no rent, no coffee, no wine, no


cigarettes. the landlord stated: one more day; get it up or get it out—!


“shit, I thought you knew what you were doing,” she told Smaltz. it was the first time she wasn’t funny.


“don’t worry, baby, I’ll get it,” he told her, and they went one last good one.


lucky, he had the .32. he thought, liquor store, no, I’ll get the big stuff, she’s got it


comin’, she’s for me, mine, paper hat, all that shaking, god, nothing like it.




he tried the bank. the big gray one nearby.


he went in. he was ready: .32, paper bag, the note:


“a stickup. quiet and you don’t die. no buttons. put money in bag. I am desperate and will kill. please let us both live.”








101




she emptied the drawer into the bag. he saw it:


lots of hundreds, fifties. sweet mother. a trip to Paris. the bank clerk looked good too. he’d like to fuck her. anybody would.


he was almost at the door


when he sensed she’d tripped the button right away. they’d even cleared the


crowd. the guard at the door was easy— he was so fat Smaltz couldn’t miss: he dropped like a putty freak.


outside he saw the squad car;


the thing was driving along the wrong side of the street—how could they do that?— keeping even as he was running, and firing at his ass,


coming close; he ran up an alley, dead end, but he caught a freight elevator


at the bottom, “move it up! MOVE IT UP!” he shouted at another freak but the freak just stood there


looking at the .32, and he shot the freak, nothing else to do,


and he was working at the handles, trying to close the doors


when they got there, fired at him,


fired into that cheap tin elevator; he couldn’t get off a return shot. they got him, took the paper bag out of his hand.








102




the next night she was sleeping with the owner of a hardware store, Harry, a good solid income, 2 fingers missing from his right hand—hunting accident in Indiana, 1938.


you could get another shipping clerk anywhere.

the telephone message machine






is one of the world’s greatest


inventions.


seldom do I pick up the phone


to interrupt the


message


and speak directly to the


caller.


and I hardly ever phone


anybody


these days


nor did I in the


past


unless it was some new girlfriend


who had me by the


balls.


and she never had an


answering machine


just pills


unpaid bills


neglected children


many pressing needs


and an utterly overvalued sense of her


self,


especially by


me.














104
that nice girl who came in to change the sheets






I met her when she came in to


change the sheets.


St. Louis.


she told me: you’re sick.


and I said:


yes, I’m sick.


and she said:


you need something to drink


I came to change the sheets


but you need something to drink


give me some money and


I’ll come back with something to


drink.


so


I gave her the money


not knowing her


but she came back with something to drink.


she sat in a chair and I


stayed in bed and we drank


silently.


and then we began to talk


and then we laughed a little


and I began to feel better and she


looked better


and I said:


I didn’t think you’d come back


and she said:


hell, I work here.


and I said:


o, that’s why you came


back.


105




and she said:


no, that’s not why I came back.


and


I liked that.


I hardly remember how it happened but we were soon both in bed smoking cigarettes and drinking beer


out of those heavy quart


jugs.


there seemed no hurry.


and then it began to


work. I don’t know how it worked


but it was all right. we


fucked.


and she got up and closed the windows to the south and said:


that’s what’s killing you


those gas fumes coming up from the avenue that


and the drinking. at least we can get you away from the gas fumes.


we laughed and then she got back in bed and we talked some more and smoked and she got out of bed and said


she had to go—


her boyfriend lived downstairs with her, and I said goodbye








106




and she left and


then I looked over at the chair


and I saw the clean white sheets.


she had forgotten to change the sheets so I got up and


changed the sheets for her.

an agreement on Tchaikovsky






both my legs are broken at the knees and I can’t move my right arm:
it’s Spring and the birds are popping in and out of the brush driving the cats crazy.


my good friend, Randy, frequents the men’s crappers at the racetrack looking for wallets: smart boy: if his folks had been rich


he tells me he would have gone


on to Harvard.


she keeps playing Tchaikovsky’s 4th, the one that goes


ka plunk plunk plunk plunk plunk; I don’t like it


but old lady Rose


my neighbor


at the Sunset Park Rest Home


thinks it’s


beautiful.


everybody’s too old here to use


the tennis court


there’s a layer of dust over the whole thing and the net’s a bunch of busted string.


old lady Rose went to visit her kids today— that is, they came and got her, the old bag; she can’t walk at all


and her legs aren’t even busted—


108




she’s just a tiresome old


fart!


I wheeled myself into her room a while back and found a 10-dollar bill folded real neat and tight;


she thought nobody’d find it


in one of her old slippers


but I’ve been around


and she’ll come knocking on my door tonight asking for a “little touch of scotch”;


man, all that crap about the land she USED


to own in Arizona and how her husband USED to wear spats and carry a cane!


he don’t need to wear anything where he’s at now; and while I was in there


I cracked old Tchaikovsky #4 across the arm of a chair broke it good.


and old lady Rose was right:


it sounded damned beautiful to me:


something like


the cracking of walnuts.

love song to the woman I saw Wednesday


at the racetrack




remembering Savannah 20 years ago a four poster bed


and streets full of helmets and hunters


things I did then


left welts;


ha ha, you say,


but they come alive as I buy bread


or lace a shoe


and it doesn’t matter


except that it works for me


like the legs of that woman worked for me


as the sun works for me as it works for the cactus


and as you work for me


reading this poem.


and the legs of that woman walk


as I watch them


and the horses in the next race


and the mountains stand there


watching


welts and a woman’s legs


10-win on number six


and out in the ocean


or standing in the park


like a statue


I watch her


walking.












110




horses standing everywhere: Savannah-like seashells in my pocket: I have loved you woman


as surely as I have named you


rust and sand and nylon.


you have worked for me


wild thing.

possession






an old woman talks to a girl who is


drying her long black hair while sitting on a back step, she points her finger and speaks in a foreign tongue and the sun is very beautiful


as the old woman talks and combs the tangled strands (so many moons have gone down before and since). suddenly the young girl cries out and shakes her head and together they go back into the house where together they will die,


but don’t they understand


it was mine, not theirs:


the hair, the long black sun-dried hair, and maybe the girl too?

six






10:30 a.m.


5 coffee drinkers at the Pickwick Café the boys who work the horse stables at Hollywood Park


turn in their swivel seats


together,


one, two, three, four, five,


they turn


leaving their cooling coffees and their small talk


to stare at a girl walking by


who comes in and sits in a booth.


it is hardly an unusual girl,


just a girl,


and one, two, three, four,


four of them turn back to their coffees; the 5th, a young healthy blond boy continues to look


with his nice vacant blue eyes.


then, at last, he turns back to his coffee. it has to be more than it appears, I think, ah yes, let me see,


they are thinking, that’s the one who fucked Mick out behind the stables last night.


yes, yes, of course, they are punishing her for not fucking them.


nasty boys; little horse turd egos.


they all believe they have cocks like stallions.


“another coffee?” the waitress asks me.


“yes, thanks,” I say, thinking, I should get a


better look at that girl


myself.

man mowing the lawn across the way from me






I watch you walking with your machine. ah, you’re too stupid to be cut like grass, you’re too stupid to let anything violate you— the girls won’t use their knives on you they don’t want to


their sharp edge is wasted on you,


you are interested only in baseball games and western movies and grass blades.


can’t you take just one of my knives? here’s an old one—stuck into me in 1955, she’s dead now, it wouldn’t hurt much. I can’t give you this last one—


I can’t pull it out yet,


but here’s one from 1964, how about taking this 1964 one from me?


man mowing the lawn across the way from me don’t you have a knife somewhere in your gut where love left?


man mowing the lawn across the way from me


don’t you have a knife somewhere deep in your heart where love left?


man mowing the lawn across the way from me


don’t you see the young girls walking down the sidewalks now with knives in their purses?


don’t you see their beautiful eyes and dresses and hair?


don’t you see their beautiful asses and knees and ankles?


114




man mowing the lawn across the way from me is that all you see—those grass blades?


is that all you hear—the drone of the mower?


I can see all the way to Italy


to Japan


to Honduras


I can see the young girls sharpening their knives


in the morning and at noon and at night, and


especially at night, o,


especially at night.

the girl outside






it is 1:30 p.m.


Monday


65 degrees in November


on Western Avenue.


a girl walks out of a doorway


and stands in front.


an older woman comes out and leans against the doorway.


the girl is in her early twenties


dressed in a short buttoned-up


red dress. she has on panty hose and orange slippers


and gives the appearance of one


who has just awakened.


she grins in the afternoon.


she does a short sexy dance and grins.


she is pale. she is blonde.


suddenly she waves at somebody passing in a car.


life is interesting.


she is young.


she is a girl.


she dances again. she waves. she


grins.


that’s all very nice for 1:30 in the


afternoon at 65 degrees.


she wants money.


she waves. she dances.


she grins.


the older woman is bored and walks back inside.






116




I start my car in the parking lot across the street.


I drive west down Oakwood and no longer see the girl.


it’s so strange. I think,


we all need money.


then I turn on the radio and try to


forget about


that.

the chicken






I came by, she said,


and I hung this roasted chicken on your doorknob and two days later it was still hanging there swinging in the wind.


you should have seen that thing!


and your car was outside


and the chicken kept swinging


and I said to my husband,


what’s that stink?


he must be dead.


the wind was really blowing that


chicken around, you should have seen that chicken swing, and I told my husband, that crazy son-of-a-bitch must be dead in there.


so he got the key and we went in.


yeah, I said, what did you find?


just empty bottles and garbage. you were gone. you weren’t in there.


did you look in all the closets?


we looked everywhere, under the bed, everywhere.


I wonder where I was?


I dunno. where did you get that big scab on your head?






118




I was toasting a marshmallow on a coat hanger


and burned my fore-


head.


oh, I thought maybe somebody hit you.


uh-uh, I said, uh-uh.














































































119
an ancient love






I don’t remember our ages:


we must have been between 5 and 7,


there was this girl next door about my age.


I do remember her name: Lila Jane. and one thing she would do every day, once a day, was to ask me: “are you ready?”


and I would indicate that I was and she would lift her dress and show me her panties and they were a different color each day.


several decades later she somehow found me and came by with her boyfriend some fellow who smoked a pipe


and who read my books


and she crossed her long beautiful legs high


but not high enough for me to see the panties.


and when they were ready to leave


I gave her a hug and


I shook hands with her boyfriend


and I never saw him or her


or her panties


ever again.




















120
match point






read in the paper where a 72-year-old wife strangled her 91-year-old husband with his necktie.


she said the age difference was


unbearable and added that


when they had met on a tennis court 30 years earlier


the age gap had not seemed


important.


it looks like I’ve been in serious danger at least a half dozen times


in the last 25 years or so and still


am.


there’s just one necktie in my


closet, purchased it to go to a funeral not long ago,


but I’ve never played


tennis and don’t intend to


try.




































121
I also like to look at ceilings






there are policemen in the street


and angels in the clouds


and jockeys riding in their silks.


down through the mornings


up through the nights


parallel to the afternoons


there are crippled dogs in


East Kansas City


vampires in Eugene, Oregon


and a long walk for a glass of water in the Twin Cities.


I meant to write Angela


I really did


and thank her for everything


because I sincerely


liked the way she draped shawls on her staircase


and her herb tea


and the green vines in her


bathroom


the view from her bedroom


and her collection of


Vivaldi.


but I didn’t.


I guess I’m crueler than


I think I am.








122
no Cagney, me






I had a borrowed tv set for a month


and saw some old Cagney movies.


much of Cagney’s interaction with women takes place in the kitchen. they say something he doesn’t


like. he slaps them with a dish towel or pushes a grapefruit into their face. they weep and fall into his arms.


me, I am always being attacked by


women


especially when I am discouraged or tired. they push me out of doorways into the rain, into mud puddles on my back. they pour beer over my head come at me with knives and bookends they attack


snarling like the leopard


they rip my coats and shirts


apart.


they attack me at the moment


I am casually talking to a


friend or while I am


asleep. sometimes they also beat their heads against the wall.


I’m leaving, I say.


oh, you always want to end it,


don’t you?


123




well, Christ, you act like you don’t


like it.


well, go then, go!


I go. no Cagney, me. I drive away thinking, oh shit, God, it’s so nice to be alone again.


you had it, Jimmy.


what a woman wants is a


reaction.


what a man wants is a


woman.


you’re best.

soup, cosmos and tears






I’ve known some crazy women


but the craziest was


Annette


and it seems the crazier they are


the better the lay,


and what bodies they


have. Annette always lived with


Chinese men


but you never saw them


that’s what scared you,


even the Mafia is scared of the Chinese— “where’s the dragon, kid?”


“that’s all right. he knows you’re all right.”


“you sure? when they put the X on you,


you might as well


forget it.”


“I told them you were all right. that’s all they need.”


Annette had incense burning,


all sorts of charts and weirdo books, she always talked about the gods she had a direct line to the gods.
“you have been selected by the gods,” she told me.


“o.k., babe, let’s make it


then.”


“not right now. I want you to try this special soup


I’ve made.”


“special soup?”


“yes, eat it and you will inherit the forces of earth and sun, the entire cosmos.”






125




I went and ate the soup. frankly, it tasted all right,


though a bit rusty. no telling what the hell she had


put in there. I finished


it.


“I feel like a man of steel


now.”


“you have inherited the force,” she said, “the gods are proud of you.”


on the couch I finally got hold of


her. under that loose orange gown


was enough woman to kill an


ox.


“I lived in that hotel in Paris,” she said. “I slept with all of


them. Burroughs, the whole


gang. I knew Pound at St. Liz.”


“you slept with Ezra?”


“more than any!”


“oh fuck!”


“go,” she laughed, “ahead.”


it had been good


soup. those Paris boys and


Ezra had known a good


mare.


* rolled off.


when she came out of the bathroom she


had a bottle in her hand and began sprinkling me


with the


contents.


“hey, what’s this shit?”


126




“the tears of the


gods.”


“the tears of the gods?”


“yes, the tears of the


gods.”


I laid there until she was


finished.


then I got up and


dressed.


“when can I see you


again?”


“in 2 hours or


tomorrow.”


I walked to the door.


“you walk like a


poem,” she said.


“see you in 2


hours,” I told


her.


the door closed. what a man had to go through for a piece of ass


in this modern age was


highly


suspect.












127
peacock or bell






I am laughing mouth closed;


as I turn the pages of my newspaper it’s like a symphony gone wrong; seeing much to make me doubt flashing there across the page
it’s like a cheap movie gone haywire; my clothing sits in chairs like the dead emptied out,


husks of things wrinkling the vision; it’s colder than hell (yes) but the blankets are thin,


and the pulled-down shades


are as full of holes as love is.


I think you’ve got to be a sportsman; yes, for the sportsman it’s all right: you just crack out the gun
and blow the head off something


perhaps off the maiden sitting in


the chair that grandma sat in,


but not having a gun,


I go to the phone


and phone a woman as old as the chair and grandma, and she promises to come and charm me; she has a toothbrush but no teeth


and I will probably dance naked for her my blob of belly a white sack.


each man has his own way out: mine is doubtful but has been working well of late


and the music of it sometimes frightens me,












128




but then


I wake up, buy a paper,


kick a can,


pull up the shade,


start again.

purple and black






a girl in purple pants and black sweater crossing the street


with a camper and high-rise background,


a Saturday afternoon graveyard Hollywood background,


is quite interesting:


something moving,


something moving in purple and black as her hair waves in the wind as she turns, the sun like the eye of a frog, winter is where it’s at


here, and the street is insipid, vapid,


I could pound myself against that asphalt until I bled mad


and it wouldn’t care;


the girl in purple and black


gives the street destination and direction until she is out of range of my window, and now it is again


what it was, and a small spider


almost like something made out of a lost hair, an eyelid hair,


crawls along the wall to my left


and I don’t have even the desire to


kill it. outside my window


it is ghost-shivered and


stinks of the malice of men.


I wait for new arrangements














130




but meanwhile endure


as the phone rings


as I leap from my chair


like a man shot in the


back.

fulfillment






she disciplined herself in


anger


hatred and cunning


strategy.


I always thought that it would


finally pass


that she was giddy with


misconception and bad


advice.


I always felt it would


pass.


I listened to the charges against me


knowing some of them to be true


but certainly not


important enough


to become the target of


violence, envy,


vengeance.


I thought it would surely


pass.


I commandeered no


defense


thinking that easy


reason


would save us


both






132




but her determination


strengthened—


even then


I summed it up as headstrong, over-


zealous


energy


but the moment I gave ground


more ground was


taken.


lord, I thought, it’s just simple


violence


and so I trotted my horse


out of the stable


sharpened my knives and


began a


counterattack.


she’d finally found


as good an opponent as could be


found.


her determination demanded her own destruction.


she’d found her


match


I mounted my steed


sword ready


ready even for the sun.


133




she’d always wanted war


I’d grant her wish


love be damned now


as love was damned when it


first arrived.


my reluctance would


now be gone


forever


and the blood


would flow


hers and mine


just as she desired.


















































134
yours






my women of the past keep trying to locate me. I duck into dark closets and pull the overcoats over my head.


at the racetrack I sit in the clubhouse smoking cigarette after cigarette
watching the horses come out for the post parade and looking over my shoulder.


I go to bet and this one’s ass looks like that one’s ass used to.


I duck away from her.


then that one’s hair might have her under it. I get the hell out of the clubhouse and go to the grandstand.


I don’t want a return of the past.


I don’t want a return of those


ladies of my past,


I don’t want to try again, I don’t want to see them again even in silhouette;


I give them all, all of them to all the other eager men, they can have those darlings,


those tits those asses those thighs those minds


and their mothers and fathers and sisters and


brothers and children and dogs and x-boyfriends


and current boyfriends, they can have them all and


fuck them all


if they want to.








135




I was a terrible and jealous lover who mistreated and failed to understand


them and it’s best that they are with others now for that will be better for them and that will be better for me


so when they phone or write or leave messages


I will forward them all to their new fine fellows.


I don’t deserve what they have and I want to keep it that way.






























































136
kissing me away






she was always thinking about it and she was young and beautiful and all my friends were jealous: what was an old fuck like me


doing with a young girl like


her?


she was always thinking about


it.


we’d be driving along and


she’d say, “see that little


place? park over there.”


I’d hardly get parked and


she’d be down on me.


once I drove her to Arizona


and halfway there


late at night


after coffee and doughnuts


at an all-night joint


she bent over


and started in


while I was navigating the


dark curves through the


low hills


and as I kept driving


it inspired her to


new heights.








137




another time


in L.A.


we’d purchased hot dogs and cokes


and fries and we were eating in


Griffith Park


families there


children playing


and she unzipped me


and started in.


“what the hell are you doing?”


I asked her.


later


when I asked her


why


in front of everybody


she told me it was


dangerous and thrilling


that way.


she asked me one


time, “why am I staying with an


old guy like you


anyhow?”


“so you can give me blow


jobs?” I replied.


“I hate that term!” she


said.






138




“sucking me off,” I


suggested.


“I hate that term


too!” she said.


“what would you prefer?”


I asked.


“I like to think that


I’m ‘kissing you away,’ ”


she said.


“all right,” I said.


.•        •        •


it was like any other


relationship, there was


jealousy on both sides,


there were split-ups and


reconciliations.


there were also fragmented moments of great peace and beauty.


I often tried to get away from her and she tried to get away from me but it was difficult:


Cupid, in his strange way, was really there.


whenever I had to leave town


she kissed me away


139




good


a couple of nights in a


row


ensuring my


fidelity.


then all I had to


do was


worry about


her.


when she wasn’t


kissing me away


we also found time


to do it


in several other strange


ways.


but all that time with


her it


was mostly just


being


kissed away or


waiting to be.


we never thought about


much else.


we never went to


movies (which I hated


anyhow).


we never ate


out.


140




we were not curious


about


world affairs.


we just spent our time


parked in


secluded places or picnic


grounds or


driving dark


roads to New Mexico,


Nevada and Utah.


or


we were in her big oak


bed


facing south


so much of the rest of the


time


that I memorized


each wrinkle in the


drapes


and especially


all the cracks in the


ceiling.


I used to play games with


her with that ceiling.


“see those cracks up


there?”


“where?”






141




“look where I’m pointing . . .”


“o.k.”


“now, see those cracks, see the pattern? it forms an image. do you see what it is?”


“umm, umm . . .”


“go on, what is it?”


“I know! it’s a man on top of a


woman!”


“wrong. it’s a flamingo standing


by a stream.”


.•        •        •


we finally got free of


one another.


it’s sad but it’s


standard operating procedure


(I am constantly confused by


the lack of durability in human


affairs).


I suppose the parting was


unhappy


maybe even ugly.


it’s been 3 or 4


years now


142




and I wonder if she


ever thinks of


me, of what I am


doing?


of course, I know what she’s


doing.


and she did it better


than anybody


I ever knew.


and I guess that’s worth this


poem, maybe.


if not, then at least a


footnote: that such affairs are


not without joy and humor for both


parties


and as Saigon and the enemy tanks get scrambled in old dreams as old and infirm dogs get


killed crossing roads


as the drawbridge rises to let


the drunken fishermen out to


sea


it wasn’t for nothing


that


she was thinking


about it


all the


time.


143
goodbye, my love






deadly ash of everything


we’ve mauled it to pieces


ripped the head off


the arms


the legs


cut away the sexual organs


pissed on the heart


deadly ash of everything


everywhere


the sidewalks are now harder


the eyes of the populace crueler


the music more tasteless


ash


I’m left with pure


ash


first we pissed on the heart


now we piss on the ash.






































144
heat






if you have ever drawn up your last plan on


an old shirt cardboard in an Eastside hotel room of winter with last week’s rent due and a dead radiator


you’ll know how large small things are like yourself coming up the stairway maybe for the final time with your bottle of wine


thinking of the lady in #9


putting on her garters


and on her dresser there is a


dark red drinking glass


which catches the overhead light like a soft dream of Jerusalem and she dusts herself


slips into silk and sheath and


spiked feet


and unemployed and looking for work and maybe looking for you she passes you on the


stairway;


such disturbing grace


transforms one.


like a blue-winged fly exploding into the summer sky


you decide to hang around and


die later; you enter your room and pour wine like


blood, inward, and decide in the morning you’ll


get up early and


read the want


ads.








145
the police helicopter






the police helicopter keeps circling over the yard “what do they want?” I ask her.


“they’re probably looking for you,” she says. this is not as far-fetched as you might think: I went into a bar one night with some friends and the owner came out from around the bar and asked to speak to me.


“I don’t know if we can serve you or not, you must promise to be good,


you created quite a fuss the last time you were here.”


I promised him to be good and that night I drank under a great deal of strain.


anyhow, the helicopter keeps circling and it is one o’clock in the afternoon
but the night before it had circled and circled shining its beam into the backyard and into the crapper.


it had circled for 45 minutes, then


had left.


now it is back.


“what the hell?” I say,


“they want you,” she says,


“this is ridiculous,” I say.


I walk into the backyard.


there’s nothing out there:


walnut trees, bamboo stalks, a discarded sofa and grass 3 feet high.


I stand out there and watch the helicopter






146




circling, circling.


it finally leaves.


I come back in.


“I feel like John Dillinger,” I say.


“you look like John Dillinger,” she says.


I walk to the mirror.


it’s true:


I look like John Dillinger,


but no woman in a red dress could ever


finger me. I’m


too smart.






























































147
ah






flamingo pain,


burnt fingers trying to


light the last of this


joint


in a place described


by terrified ladies


with money in their purses


as a “rat hole.”


“you can spit on the floor here,”


I tell them.


but no, from


a safe


distance, it appears


they’d rather discuss


my poetry.
















































148
of course






according to the latest scientific


study


it takes 325 years for the last


brain cell


to pop.


now I realize that


most of the girls


I met in bars


and brought home with me


were lying about


their


age.




























































149
the dream, the dream






there is always some new Carmen just around


some corner


somewhere


but then the Carmens never seem to last;


the Carmens hardly last any time at all.


I see this in the eyes of men


everywhere—


men sitting at lunch counters


men driving buses


men giving political speeches


men pulling teeth


men in tiger cages


men I see everywhere . . .


the man I see while I shave


looks back at me through slit-eyes


his Carmen also gone—


that man (me) is now


thinking about what that


razor might really


do, the thought is always


there—


but the game keeps us


going: there is always some new Carmen


waiting


somewhere


just around some


corner.






150
note on the tigress






first, a terrible argument.


next, we made love.


now, at last, I lay peacefully


on her large bed


which is


spread with a field of gracious flowers, my head and belly down, head sideways,


sprayed by shaded light


as she bathes quietly in the


other room.


it is all beyond me


as are most things.


I listen to classical music on a small radio.


she bathes.


I hear the splashing of water.


















































151
















three
  

















while most people


converse it all away


I


write it down.


poem for my daughter






I spoon it


in: strained chicken noodle dinner


junior prunes


junior fruit dessert.


spoon it in and


for Christ’s sake


don’t blame the


child


don’t blame the


govt.


don’t blame the bosses or the


working classes—


spoon it down


into that little mouth


like melted


wax.


a friend phones:


“whatya gonna do now, Hank?”


“what the hell ya mean, what am I gonna do?”


“I mean ya got responsibility now, ya gotta bring the


kid up


right.”


I feed her instead:


spoon it in!


may she achieve


a place in Beverly Hills


with never any need for unemployment compensation


155




and never have to sell to the highest bidder.


and never fall in love with a soldier or a killer of any kind.


and may she


appreciate Beethoven and Jelly Roll Morton and beautiful dresses.


she’s got a real


chance:


there was once the


Theoric Fund and now there’s the


Great Society.


“are ya still gonna play the horses? are ya still gonna drink? are ya still gonna—?”


“yes.”


she is a waving flower in the wind and the dead center of my heart—


now she sleeps beautifully like a


boat on the Nile.


maybe some day she will


bury me.














156




that would be nice


if it weren’t a


responsibility.






















































































157
sheets






those sheets you’ve got there,


said the old dame


in the housewares dept.,


are for a double bed.


do you have a double bed or a


single bed?


well, you see, I answered,


my bed is an unusual bed, it’s


kind of a single-and-a-


half.


describe your bed, she said.


what?


describe your


bed.


I’d rather not, I said.


well, said the old dame, I want you to know the sheets you’ve got there are
for a double bed, and if you’ve got a single bed, it’s against the state law.


what? I asked. say that


again.


I said, it’s against the state


law.


you mean? I asked.


I mean, you can’t bring these sheets back after you’ve opened the package.


all right, I said, give me a couple of


singles.


she treated me then with comfortable disdain. I believe the old dame had been in


158




sheets all her


life. I think they should put young girls in the sheets dept.


after all, sheets don’t make me think of sleep at all


but something else


entirely. especially crisp white new


sheets.


they ought to put old dames like her in dog food. or garden supplies. and


when she gave me the singles I knew she knew I slept


alone. like she


did.




























































159
sick leave






there I am flat on my belly, Hem is dead, Shake is dead, the fish I have caught and eaten and shitted are dead and the doc is ramming a glass tube up my ass,


a glass tube with a little light on the end of it, and I am hoping for a medical excuse for 2 more days of sick leave


and the doc plays right along: “ya got some beauts there, you oughta be cut . . .” well, the White Russians used to cut a hole in a man and take hold of the end of the intestine and nail it to a tree and then force the man to run around and around the tree.


he pulls the glass tube out of my ass and part of me along with it


he has a face like a walnut and when his nurse bends over (which is often)


her butt is like a big soft pillow or powdered doughnut, no blood, just clouds, and I say, “Doc, add a day to the excuse,
I can feel the pain all the way down to my nuts . . .” “sure,” he says, “sure, I know a lot of boys from the Post Office, all nice boys.”


at home I screw the cap off the bottle


and have the first good one; it rained while he rammed me:


the rain sits glittering in the screen


like sugar flies eating dreams,


and I split the Racing Form with my thumb, then call my bookie,


“. . . give me 2 across on Indian Blood,


5 win on Lady Fanfare, 5 place on The Rage.”






160




I hang up and think softly of Kafka


sleeping under the paws of gophers


as the lady across the hall sings to her canary.


love has clicked off and on


like a cigarette lighter


and now her love is a


bird.


it gets like that when not much happens and you play on a small stage,


and I pin my medical exemption to


the front of one of my old paintings


rub some salve up my ass


and pour another drink.

my father






my father liked rules and doing things the hard way.


he spoke of responsibilities and laws


and things that just had to be done correctly.


a man must work, a man must eat.


a man must own property and mow his lawn.


I turned out to be a drunkard and wanderer


and his hard-packed letters followed me everywhere.


I watched the pigeons in the rain in


New Orleans while his letters said,


get going, make something of yourself!


how hard the world tries and how hard everything has been for me.


my father is old and gray now and when I walk into his house he complains about the mud I track in. he


is proud of his house and garden and he sits back and waits. but I


am horrified as he speaks to me:


he has never thought of death! he does not think of dying! as he talks, his
mouth is a round hole; he leans back content upon his pillows. when I leave he says, come again, come again.


how many times and why?


who is my father? did he ever


play a mandolin or swim the icy waters?


I know my father: he is dead. there is dead mud and there is a tree branch. the tree


162




branch works easily in the wind and


between the leaves you see glimpses of the sun.


it’s quiet. it’s real. it’s warm.


and the mud on the floor is my father’s heart and his brain.




















































































163
the old woman






she lived in the last old house


on the block—


you know the kind: vine-covered, dark, quiet.


her neighbors were gone—


nothing but high-rise apartments everywhere.


you’d see her two or three times a week


pushing her little shopping cart on its two wheels;


then she’d come back with stuff in bags,


go into the house, and that was


it. she never spoke to anybody.


it was last week about 3:30 p.m.


that her house began sliding off its foundation.


it was a very slow slide


and you got the idea that the house was just stepping forward to take a walk down the street— except some of the lumber began to snap—


it sounded like rifle shots, and the house moaned just a little—a dark green moan.


somebody called the fire dept.


and men were running around shutting off the gas and shouting at each other


and telling the crowd to keep back


and along came one of those television trucks and they filmed the house sagging toward the street.


then the front door opened and the little old lady came out.


they put the camera on her and a woman ran up with a mike.


164




“how long have you been living in your house?”


“55 years.”


“do you have insurance?”


“no.”


“what will you do


now?”


“go back to Ireland,” she said.


then she walked away and left them all just standing there.






















































165
what made you lose your inspiration?






Norman is drizzling off into a self-pleased


imbecility as he sits on my couch and


giggles, pulls at his


diseased beard


and talks about his girlfriend Katrinka, Eugene Debs, F. Scott Fitzgerald and LSD.


a bad writer, almost unpublished, this gives him strength as


he sits there and tells me


that my own writing has gone way down from volcanic burst to cigarette-lighter flash.


I give him something to drink and


he gets down on the floor and


begins talking into my tape machine.


I light a cigar and


listen.


“I want to be the Number One Writer of Our


Time. I want to walk down the street and hear people say, ‘hey, look, there goes Norman!’ I want people to like my poems, I want people to go mad over my poems . . .”


I decide that this is probably an honest tape


but a bad one


and I no longer


listen.


about 30 minutes and 3 beer cans later the tape runs its little tail


out. Norman straightens his tie,


gets off his knees and sits


down.


166




“Jack M. says he’s gotta make 8 grand this year or he’s finished.”


I try another


cigar.


“I’m having luncheon with Ray


Bradbury, Tuesday.”


I don’t answer.


“Jesus!”


he suddenly leaps up, runs into my bathroom and begins vomiting. it continues for some time.


“I feel better,” he says


coming back


in.


“have another drink,” I say.


“I’ll drive you to your class in


the morning.”


“fine,” he says, skimming off the top of a beer.


then he looks at me and asks,


“where have you been published


lately?”


I wave my outstretched


palms and shrug.


“Jesus, tough! what made you lose your inspiration?”


“drink. people. marriage. people.


marriage again. a child. drink.


people. jobs. no jobs. drink and


people.”


“my professor would like you to talk to


his class. he won the Lamont Poetry Prize and he digs you.”


167




“tell your professor to go to hell. tell him


I’m finished.”


“you’re touchy.”


“no, I’m just a flash in the


pan.”


we drink and drink. soon he is asleep


on the couch, 250 pounds of him rattling the ceiling with his poetry.


I go into the bedroom and set the clock for his 10 o’clock English class. the drink goes down better now, but climbing into bed


I think, where do these bastards come from and what has happened to everybody? truly, I am losing it.


the light is out


and then a burglar alarm


somewhere nearby


sifts through his


snoring. very apt, I think,


most apt


for a very wasted night


in December


1965 or


any other time at


all.
























168
another poem about a drunk and then I’ll let you go






“man,” he said, sitting on the steps.


“your car sure needs a wash and wax.


I can do it for 5 bucks.


I got the wax, I got the rags, I got everything


* need.”


* gave him the 5 and went upstairs. when I came down 4 hours later he was sitting on the steps, drunk. he offered me a can of beer.
he said he was going to do the car the next day.


the next day he was drunk again and I loaned him a dollar for a bottle of wine. his name was Mike. a World War II veteran.


his wife worked as a nurse.


the following day I came down and he was sitting on the steps. he said,


“you know, I been sitting here looking at your car wondering how to do it best. I wanna do it real good.”


the next day Mike said it looked like rain and it sure as hell wouldn’t make any sense
to wash and wax a car when it was gonna rain.


the next day it looked like rain again.


and the next.






169




then I didn’t see him anymore.


I saw his wife and she said,


“they took Mike to the hospital, he’s all swelled up, they say it’s from drinking.”


“listen,” I told her, “he said he was going to wax my car. I gave him 5 dollars to wax my car.”




I was sitting in their kitchen


drinking with his wife


when the phone rang.


she handed the phone to me.


it was Mike. “listen,” he said, “come on down and


get me. I can’t stand this


place.”


when I got there


they wouldn’t give him his clothes


so Mike walked to the elevator in his hospital gown.


we got on and there was a kid in the elevator eating a Popsicle.


“nobody’s allowed to leave here in a gown,” he said.


“you drive this thing, kid,” I said,


“we’ll worry about the gown.”


I stopped at the liquor store for 2 six-packs


then drove home. I drank with Mike and his wife until






170




11 p.m.


then went upstairs.


“where’s Mike?” I asked his wife 3 days later.


“Mike died,” she said, “he’s gone.”


“I’m sorry,” I said. “I’m very sorry.”


it rained for a week after that and I figured the only way I’d get that 5 back was to go to bed with his wife but you know


she moved out a couple of days


later


and an old guy with white hair


moved in there.


he was blind in one eye and


played the French horn.


there was no way I wanted to make it with him.


so I had to wash and wax my own car.


























171
dead dog






Bartkowski completes a 58-yard touchdown pass to beat the Packers in the final minute. I hear it on the radio


it’s Sunday and I’m on the way to the track I should make the third race.


the Falcons hold on to win and that’s good.


I switch off the radio.


then where the Harbor Freeway branches onto the Pasadena


I see a dog up on the ramp


he’s a big one and he’s limp


but he’s still breathing.


his head is crushed.


people who have dogs in their cars and let them hang out the window when those dogs fall out on the freeway often they just keep driving.


I know how to enter the tunnel.


you take the far right lane while


the other lanes back up on the left.


I glide on through.


when I come out of the tunnel


I slide back into the fast lane.


those sons-of-bitches and their dead dogs.








172




I get to the track at 1:20 p.m.


take preferred parking


find a vacant spot at F-5


lock it up


and as I’m walking between cars


I see two men who


have broken into a car.


they are taking out the radio,


the stereo and the speakers.


they see me and I see them.


“don’t say nothin’, man!


if you do, remember we’ll see you


again some day!”


I go inside the track


it’s four minutes to post


third race coming up


the crowd has bet Shameen


with Delahousseye riding


down from 4 to 2 to 1.


Song for Two has a line of 2


and reads 3.


I rate the horses even


bet 10-win on Song for Two.


Song for Two wins the photo


the Shoe can still ride


and I’m $31 ahead.


those sons-of-bitches and their dead


dogs.


173




I lose the 4th, 5th and 6th races.


in the 7th they bet Back’n Time down to 3-to-5 off a 99 speed rating 6 furlongs down at Del Mar


but the colt is 3 years old


going against older horses


and has never gone a mile.


I can see it turning into the stretch


with a four-length lead and getting beat


at the wire


by something.


but who will do it?


there are 6 other horses.


I put $50 place on Back’n Time


and watch the race.


the colt has four lengths coming into


the stretch


then Don F.


the longest shot on the board


begins to close


and it’s tight at the wire.


they hang the photo


we wait


then they put up Don F.


at 19-to-1.


* get $2.80 place so I make $20 lose the 8th


then I’m up only $18.


174




in the 9th


I bet 10-win on Fleet Ruler


and 2-win on Forecast


then leave the track


stand out in the parking lot


listen to the announcer


who is hollering


Forecast is in front


and here comes Fleet Ruler


it’s Fleet Ruler and Forecast


at the wire.


it’s evidently a photo.


I walk to my car to get out of there


before the crowd.


I have the radio


on the race result station.


I’m still on the Pasadena Freeway


when I hear the result:


it’s Forecast


and Forecast paid $90.70


so


the day wasn’t quite wasted.


but later


when I pull into the driveway


there’s the Manx cat


with his rudimentary tail and


with his tongue hanging out.


he refuses to move for the car.


I get out


175




pick him up and


throw him in the front seat.


we drive into the garage


together.


we get out


the other two cats are waiting


(lovers of fishheads, dreamers of


birds)


I open the door


and all the cats enter along


with me.


they run into the kitchen


I notice that Dallas and San Diego are now playing. Danny White is at quarterback for Dallas.


I always liked Danny White,


he’s a gambler.


I might watch a few quarters.


Sunday’s a day of rest.


all important things should be forgotten.


I decide to not even feed the cats


for a while.


and Tuesday or Wednesday I’ll start working on my childhood novel again.














176
I live in a neighborhood of murder






the roaches spit out rusted


paper clips


and the helicopter circles and circles smelling for blood


searchlights leering down into our


bathrooms


searching for our two-lid cache under the mattress.


5 guys in this court have pistols


another a


machete


we are all murderers and


alcoholics


but there are worse in the hotel


across the street;


they sit in the green and white doorway


banal and depraved


waiting to be


institutionalized.


here we each have a dying green plant on our porch


and when we fight with our women at 3 a.m.


we do so


in hushed tones


as outside on each porch


stands a small dish of food


that is always eaten by morning


we presume


by the


cats.






177
the bombing of Berlin






the Americans and English would come over, he told me, there was nothing to stop them,


they had red and blue lights on their planes and they took their time, and it was funny, you know,


a bomb would take out an entire block and leave the block next to it standing, untouched.


once, after a raid, we heard a piano playing under the rubble


and there was an old woman under there playing the piano, the building had collapsed all around her,


buried her there and she was still playing the piano.


after a while, when the planes came again and again we wouldn’t bother to go underground anymore, we just stayed wherever we were


on first and second floors and looked up and watched


the red and blue lights and thought, goddamn them!


well, he said, picking up his beer with a sigh, we lost the war, and that’s all there is to that.


























178
all right, Camus






met this guy, somewhere, hell his eyes looked like a madman’s or maybe it was only my reflection there. well, anyway, he said to me, you read Camus?


we’re both in this womanless bar looking


for a piece of ass or some way out through the top of the sky and


it wasn’t working—there was just the bartender wondering why he’d ever gone into the business


and myself, very discouraged with the fact that I had now been trans-lated only


into 6 or 7 languages.


the guy kept talking—


The Stranger, you know, the book that depicts our modern society— about the deadened man who


couldn’t cry at his mother’s funeral, who


killed an Arab or two without even knowing why—


he kept on and on


and on and on


telling me what a son-of-a-bitch The Stranger was, and I kept thinking maybe he’s right—
you know, those awful speeches before the French Academy— you couldn’t tell whether Camus was talking out of the side of his mouth or


whether he was


serious. he certainly sounded no better then than the guy next to me at the bar and we were only looking for


pussy.








179




it was very sad—


all along The Stranger had been my hero because I thought he’d seen beyond trying or caring


because it was all such a bore


so senseless—


life a big hole in the ground looking up— and I was wrong again:


hell, I was The Stranger and the book simply hadn’t come out the way


it was meant to


be.


































































180
quits






they made their first mistake when they


laid the champ


facedown


on the dressing room table—


it was a cancer


scream—


and then he cursed them in poor man’s Italian and said


turn me over turn me over turn me over you assholes


turn me over,


and they did


and he said,


he broke every rib on my left side


he’s a murderer, he’s not a fighter,


and then he


said,


look, get me a gun, I’m going to kill that son-of-a-bitch.


take it easy, champ, said his manager, it wasn’t for the title, you still got the title. you can beat him


in the rematch. we ain’t signed the contract to fight Sondelle yet. we’ll hold off on Sondelle and get this guy in the rematch.




I’m not fighting that killer again, said the champ,


they ought to bar that dirty cocksucker from the ring.






181




look, champ, said his manager, don’t be stupid, we’ll get a real big gate for the next


one, they’ll want to see if he can


do it again.


the champ cursed them in Italian and then said, you’ll never get me in the ring with that killer again.


look, champ, he’s a bum I tell you, a bum, he’s never beat anyboby before. next time you dance away, lay off the


drinking and fucking for a


week, he can’t


touch you when you’re right. he can’t beat shit, champ.


he beat


me. I’ll never take another beating like that for anyone.


you gonna quit, champ? you gonna quit?


I’ll fight anyone but that


guy.


all right














182




so, o.k., how about an X-ray of my


ribs? I can’t breathe, really, I


feel them poking into my


lung.


they took him out of there and drove him in a low


long black


limousine


to the private hospital where the


X-rays showed


no breaks.


they’re lying, screamed the champ, the fucking idiots are lying! don’t you think I


can feel my own bones when they are broken?


nobody said anything.












































183
Adolf






I have a friend who has a


scrapbook devoted to Hitler


and his Nazi buddies


and the walls are


covered with old


snapshots of Al Capone


Fatty Arbuckle


Roy Rogers and


many many others.


the walls are limp with rotting glue and memories, and there are hidden switches that set off a frenzy of colored


lights—


each pattern different,


never


the same—


and down in his cellar there are


tons of rain-fattened and rat-


eaten


papers; it’s very


dark down there


and there are many


half-finished paintings with


one eye staring up at you


from the floor.


we leave and


go up a


syphilitic staircase and back into


the kitchen where


a hog’s head is swimming


in a very large white


184




pot along with


onions


carrots


potatoes,


one small onion floating in an


empty eye,


and there’s his


daughter


2 and one half feet tall


who remembers me


from another


day.


she says some genuine funny things


to us


then walks away into an


upstairs


bedroom


while her father and I sit around


listening to old German


marching songs


and smoking


Picayunes.

the anarchists






one time I began sitting around my place with some fellows with long dark beards who were very intense.


many people come to see me but


I usually roust them after a while.


none of them ever bring women,


they hide their women.


I drink beer and listen, but not too


attentively.


but this particular crowd kept coming back. to me it was mostly beer and chatter. I noticed that they


usually arrived in a caravan and had some central yet confused organization. I kept telling them that I didn’t give
a fuck—either about America or about them. I just kept sitting there and each morning when I awakened they’d be gone— and that was best.


finally they stopped coming and a few months later I wrote a short story about their political chatter—which, of course, trashed their idealism.
the story was published somewhere and about a month later the leader walked in, sat down and split a six-pack.
“I want to tell you something, Chinaski, we read that story. we held a council and took a vote on whether to murder you or not. you were spared, 6 to 5.” I laughed then, some years ago,


but I no longer laugh. and even


186




though I paid for most of the beer and even though


some of you fellows pissed on the


toilet lid, I now appreciate that


extra vote.




















































































187
perfect white teeth






I finally bought a color tv


and the other night


I hit on this movie


and here’s a guy in


Paris


he has no money


but he wears a very good suit


and his necktie is knotted perfectly and he’s neither worried nor drunk but he’s in a café


and all the beautiful women are


in love with him


and somehow he keeps paying his rent and walking up and down staircases in very clean shirts


and he advises a few of the girls


that while they can’t write poetry


he can


but he doesn’t really feel like it


at the moment—


he’s looking for Truth instead.


meanwhile he has a perfect haircut


no hangover


no nervous tics around the eyes and perfect white teeth.


I knew what would happen:


he’d get the poetry, the women and the Truth.












188




I popped off the tv set


thinking, you dumb-ass son-of-a-bitch


you deserve


all


three.

4 blocks






I drove my daughter to the school auditorium where her mother was to meet her at 5 p.m.


I let her out of the car


and she reached her head back through the window and kissed me


as she always did.


she was 8. I was 52.


two fat women stood watching us. I waved goodbye to my daughter and as she walked to the doorway one of the fat women asked her, “wait a minute, who was that man?” and she answered, “that’s my daddy.” then one of the fatsos ran toward me: “wait a minute, can I get a ride, just 4 blocks?”


“I have a very dirty car,” I said.


“I don’t mean to intrude,” she said, getting in,


“just follow the road. it’s not far.”


I followed the road.


“Marina,” she said, “is a very nice girl, we all like Marina.”


“yes,” I said, “she’s a very quiet and gentle girl.”


“yes,” she answered, “yes, she is.”


“I’m usually very quiet and gentle too,” I said.


“well,” she replied, “I guess if you don’t praise yourself, nobody else will, hahaha!”




190




“it’s quite windy today,” I said.


“now,” she said, “go two blocks north, then turn right.”


“all right,” I said, “I will.”


“I hope,” she said, “that I’m not taking you too far out of your way? I hope that I’m not intruding?”


“have you met Marina’s mother?” I asked.


“oh yes,” she said, “she’s a lovely person, quite a lovely person.”


“are you sure somebody else will?” I asked.


“will what?” she asked.


“praise you if you don’t praise yourself,” I replied.


“well,” she said, “it’s 3 more blocks, then you take a right.”


I ran up 3 blocks and took a


right.


“now,” she said, “see that truck with the gate hanging open?”


“I see it,” I said.


“you just park right there by that truck and I’ll get out.”


I parked there and she got


out.


“I sure want to thank you,” she said, “and I hope I didn’t intrude.”


“I’ll see you around,” I said,


“take care of yourself.”








191




I drove ahead and took another right onto a one-way street. the ocean was down there. there was not a sailboat in sight. vaguely I wondered about flying fish


dismissed them as a myth


spun my car around


at the first opportunity


and headed back


to Los Angeles.

you can’t force your way through


the eye of the needle




tearing up poems is my


specialty.


on a given night


I will write between 5 and a


dozen


feeling very good about


all of


them.


the next day


in the cold morning


light


I face them


again:


some have


at best


only a decent line or


two.


to rip and basket


these failures


is pure


pleasure.


there are some


days


when all of them


go.


the poem is hardly the


core of our


193




existence


although


there have been many


poets


who felt that


it


was.


whatever they are,


the gods are not


dumb.


they must laugh


and wonder


at our


fever for


fame.

two kinds of hell






I sat in the same bar for 7 years, from 6 a.m.


until 2 a.m.


sometimes I didn’t remember going back to my room.


it was as if I was sitting on that bar stool continuously.


I had no money but somehow the drinks kept coming.


I wasn’t the bar clown but rather the bar fool.


but often a fool can find an even greater fool to


treat him to drinks.


fortunately,


it was a crowded


place.


but I had a point of view: I was waiting for something extraordinary to happen.




but as the years drifted past


nothing ever did unless I


caused it:


a broken bar mirror, a fight with a 7-foot giant, a dalliance with a lesbian,


the ability to call a spade a spade and to






195




settle arguments that I did not


begin, and etc.


one day I just upped and left.


just like that.


and as I began to drink alone I found my own company more than satisfactory.


then, as if the gods were annoyed by my peace of mind, the ladies began knocking at my door. the gods were sending ladies to the fool!




the ladies arrived one at a time and when one left


the gods immediately—without allowing me any respite—would send another.


and each seemed at first to be a fresh miracle, but then everything that at first seemed wonderful ended up badly.




my fault, of course, yes, that’s what they usually told me.


the gods just won’t let a man drink alone; they are jealous of simple pleasures; so they send a lady to knock upon your door.


I remember all those cheap hotels; it was as if all the women were one; the first delicate rap on the wood and then,
“oh, I heard you playing that lovely music on your radio. we’re


196




neighbors. I’m down in 603 but I’ve never seen you in the hall before!”


“come on in.”


and there went your sanctity.


you also remember the time when


you walked up behind the 7-foot giant and knocked off his cowboy hat, yelling,


“I’ll bet you’re too tall to suck your mother’s nipples!”


and somebody in the bar saying, “hey, sir, forget it, he’s a mental case, he’s an asshole, he doesn’t know what he is saying!”


“I know EXACTLY what I am saying and I’ll say it again, ‘I’ll bet you were too tall . . .’ ”


he won the fight but you didn’t die, not the way you died inside after the gods arranged for all those ladies to come knocking at your door.


the fistfight was more fair: he was slow, stupid and even a little


bit frightened and the battle went well enough for you for quite a while, just like it did at first with those ladies the gods sent.




the difference being, I decided, I at least had a chance with the ladies.

my faithful Indian servant






I reached over to turn on


the lights. the lights were already on. I was in a bad way. “Hudnuck!” I bawled for my faithful Indian servant. “kiss my sack,” he answered. in the dim light


I saw him on the couch with


my wife. I stepped outside


and blew my bugle.


3 camels answered my call, and came running across the yard. “Hudnuck!” I bawled.


“hold your horses, daddy-o,” he answered, “until I’m finished.”


I blew my bugle. nothing happened.


it was full of spit and


tears.


Hudnuck stepped out on the


porch, pulling his zipper closed.


“I want a raise,” he said,


“I’m working for nothing.”


“and I’m living for nothing, Hud:


don’t you realize that


I’m a broken man?”


“don’t talk that way,” he said,


“you’ve got a nice wife.”


my wife stepped out on the


porch. “what are you having


for breakfast, darling?” she


asked.


“bacon and eggs,” I answered.


“not you, you fool! she snapped.


198




“t-bone and liver sausage,” said


Hudnuck.


“thank you, darling,” said my nice


wife, going back into our


nest.


I blew my bugle. a crow answered.


Hudnuck ripped the bugle


from my hand. he wiped it


across the front of my best


shirt. (he was wearing


it.)


he played “Hearts and Flowers”


on the damn thing. the tears


welled up in my eyes.


I decided to give him a


raise. looking over, I saw


him twisting my bugle into


the shape of a cross as he


whistled “It Ain’t Gonna


Rain No More.”


he had strong, sensitive, beautiful


hands. I looked down at my own.


at first I couldn’t find them. then quickly I took them out of my pockets and applauded


him.


















199
a plausible finish






there ought to be a place to go


when you can’t sleep


or you’re tired of getting drunk


and the grass doesn’t work anymore, and I don’t mean to go to hash or cocaine,


I mean a place to go to besides


the death that’s waiting


or to a love that doesn’t work


anymore.


there ought to be a place to go


when you can’t sleep


besides to a tv set or to a movie


or to buy a newspaper


or to read a novel.


it’s not having that place to go to


that creates the people now in madhouses and the suicides.


I suppose what most people do


when there isn’t any place to go


is to go to some place or to something that hardly satisfies them,


and this ritual tends to sandpaper them


down to where they can somehow continue even without hope.














200




those faces you see every day on the streets


were not created


entirely without


hope: be kind to them:


like you


they have not


escaped.

another one of my critics






I haven’t written a good poem


in weeks. she’s 15


and she walks in.


“bastard, when are you going to get out of bed?”


it’s ten minutes to noon


so I get up and walk to the typewriter.


she walks up in a Yankees baseball cap and stares at me.


“DON’T BUG ME!” I scream. “I AM WRITING!” “imbecile,” she says and walks off.


staring at that sheet of white paper


I begin to think that some of my critics are right.


she walks into the room again and looks at me.


“blubbermouth,” she says, “hello, blubbermouth.” I ignore her.


she reaches up and tugs at my beard. “hey, when you gonna take that mask off? I’m sick of that mask.”


then she goes to the bathroom


and with the door open she sits on the pot.


she strains: “urrg, urrg, urrg . . .”


I look over.


“listen, you’re supposed to


close the bathroom


door when you do that.”


“well, close it then, dummy,” she says.


I get up and close it.






202




I know a writer who spent 2 thousand dollars to have a cork-lined room built for


himself but it still didn’t improve his work. I think I’ll take my chances this way.

fog






worst fog


I ever saw


was driving back from


the beach


with my buddy Desmond


when


it came


in


it was so thick


you


could cut it with


your proverbial


knife.


and we were quite


drunk


we couldn’t pull


over because


we were afraid of


hitting cars already parked


at the


curb


but we stopped a


moment and


Desmond climbed up


on the hood


and knelt there






204




and said, “o.k.,


let’s go, I’ll


guide you!”


and I started


up and


Desmond yelled,


“SHIT! I CAN’T


SEE ANYTHING!”


and he began


laughing and I


began laughing


I could barely


see his ass


bunched up there on


the hood


and then he


said it


again: “SHIT!


I CAN’T SEE


ANYTHING!”


and we both began


laughing again


harder


a laughter we


couldn’t stop








205




the fog all


around us


as we drove


on


we just kept


driving and


laughing


we slipped through


intersection after


intersection


often hearing


engines and horns


but seeing


nothing


until at one


intersection the


fog lifted a


bit


I could make out


a gas station


* café there was a green light


and


Desmond was


missing








206




I pulled over


and parked in the


gas station and


waited


and there came


Desmond walking up


through the


fog


I hollered and


waved and he saw


me


ran to the car


and got in


we drove on into


L.A.


a week later


he went to


Illinois to see


the wife he


had


split with


and I never


saw him


again.

free?






there’s an airline


they offer free champagne


but I’ve been there


before.


when the stewardess came by


I said, no.


it was warm and


it came right out of the


bottle.


the stewardesses went up and down pouring refills.


it was a smooth flight


but then it


began:


restroom runs.


lines formed.


the barf bags came


out.


I sat there


listening to the


moaning and the


puking.














208




when we got to the airport


some were still


going at


it.


some puked as they waited for their


baggage. others puked on the


escalators and in the parking lot.


some puked in their cars while


driving home. some were still puking at


home.


when I got home


I switched on the news


opened a cold beer


and let the bath water


run.

imported punch






they keep bringing fighters up


from Brazil and Argentina


with records like 11–2–1 or


7–4–0


and they’re all 27 or 28 years


old


and they put them in with


our boys


with records like


22–0–0,


ages 21 or


22.


the Brazilians and Argentines


fight proudly


and


they hardly lack


guts


but they are built


short and slow


still use boxing


techniques that went out


in the


twenties.


it’s more than sad


and I wonder what


these Brazilians and


Argentines think


after they are


bloodied


and then


k.o.’d?


210




it’s just


another dumb fucking flight


back to South America


for them


as they pass their


compatriots


flying North


with no chance


at all.

it was an UNDERWOOD






my poems keep renouncing each


other—


this one says this


and that one says that,


and the other says something else


but I find it humorous


as they battle back and


forth—


angry featherweights, well,


maybe welterweights,


and then I walk into a stationery store— after all that furious battle— look at the typewriter ribbons


and can’t remember


the name of


the machine.


even my typewriter


renounces itself—


“pardon me,” I squeeze by the girl at the register, “they didn’t have what I wanted.”


then I walk across the way


where they do


and buy 6 of those


brews that made


Milwaukee


famous.

the creation coffin






the ability to suffer and endure,


that’s nobility, friend.


the ability to suffer and endure


for an idea, a feeling, a way,


that’s art, my friend.


the ability to suffer and endure


when love fails,


that’s hell, old friend.


nobility, art and hell,


let’s talk about art for a while.


destiny is my crippled daughter.


look here, it’s difficult,


me against them,


with them.


Kafka, let me in!


Hemingway beware!


Hegel, you’re funny!


Cervantes, you mean you wrote that


novel at the age of


80?


great writers are indecent people


they live unfairly


saving the best part for paper.


good human beings save the world


so that bastards like me can keep creating art, become immortal.


if you read this after I am long dead


it means I made it.






213




so writers of the world


it’s your turn now


to misuse your wife


abuse your children


love thyself


live off the funds of others


dislike all art created before and


during your time,


and dislike or even hate humanity


singly or en masse.


bastards, even if you read this


after I am long dead


forget about me. I


probably wasn’t that


good.

the 7 horse






two old guys behind me are talking. “look at the 7 horse. he’s 35-to-1. how can he be 35-to-1?”


“yeah, he looks good to me too,” says the other old guy.


“let’s bet him.”


they get up to make their bets.


I’ve already bet. I’ve got 40-win


on the 2nd favorite.


I win four days out of five at the


racetrack. it doesn’t seem to be


a problem.


I open my newspaper, read the financial section, get depressed, turn to the front page looking for robbery, rape, murder.


the two old men are back.


“look, the 7 horse is 40-to-1 now,”


says one of them.


“I can’t believe it!” says the


other.


the horses are loaded into the gate, the flag goes up, the bell rings, they break out.






215




it’s a mile-and-one-sixteenth, they


take the first turn, go down the backstretch,


circle the last turn, come down the homestretch, get to the finish line.


the 2nd favorite wins by a neck, pays $7.80. I make $116.00.


there is silence behind me.


then one of the old men says, “the 7 horse didn’t run at all.”


“nope,” says the other, “I don’t understand it.”


“maybe the jock didn’t try,” says


his friend.


“that must be it,” says


the other.


like most others in the world


they believe that failure


is caused by some factor


besides themselves.


I watch the two old guys as they


bend over their Racing Form


to make a selection in the


next race.








216




“gee, look at this!” says one of them.


“they got Red Rabbit 10-to-1


on the morning line. he looks better than the favorite.”


“let’s bet him,” says the other old


guy.


they leave their seats and move gently to the betting window




































































217
the suicide






I had recently buried a woman I lived with


for three years


was between jobs


my teeth rotting in my mouth


(I burned away the pain with aspirin and beer).


I was sitting on the broken couch watching evening change into night when the phone rang.


it was Morrie.


“yes, Morrie?”


“listen, Mark’s here. he says he’s got to see you! he says he’s going to commit suicide!”


“put him on . . .”


“no, he can’t talk, he’s over the


edge!”


I stepped on a passing roach.


“give me your father,” I told him.


Bernie took the wire.


“listen, Bernie,” I said, “what’s this bullshit about Mark?”








218




“it’s true! he said that if you don’t


get over here now he’s going to kill himself!


he needs help, Hank!”


“you think he’s really going to


do it?”


“I wouldn’t kid about a thing like


this!”


“it’s a long way to San Bernardino.”


“it’s only 50 miles! you can make it


in 45 minutes.”


“all right, Bernie . . .”


I finished my beer, walked to my


12-year-old car.


it started and I got on the


freeway.


it was a long, drab, stupid ride.


Mark was one of those people who


always insisted that our friendship


was real


no matter how much effort I


exerted to


stay away from him.








219




I finally pulled up in front of the


house.


I got out of the car, knocked.


Morrie answered the door.


he had a head tic.


when something upset him his


head started jumping.


it was jumping all over in


the doorway.


“Mark’s been staying with us,”


he said, “for the last couple of


weeks.”


I walked in.


Mark was sitting on the couch


holding a beer.


he smiled at me.


he was dressed in Bernie’s old


bathrobe.


he didn’t look


as if he was


contemplating


suicide.


“where’s your father?” I asked


Morrie.












220




“he went to sleep. he went to


bed. he isn’t feeling


good.”


“it’s only 7:30.”


“he isn’t feeling good.”


I sat down. there was a fire going


in the fireplace.


“how about a beer?” Morrie asked,


his head jumping.


“sure. where’s your mother?”


“she’s not home.”


Mark cleared his throat. then, in his quiet voice he began to talk about


his writing: he was now into serial killers. he had written a novel. he had an


agent. he’d been over to see her that afternoon. she had a swimming pool. they had had a swim together in her pool. she was a looker with great connections. she realized that his writing was exceptional. she was going to take over his career and make him famous and . . .












221




I tuned him out as he went on and on.


he was wearing a silk scarf around his fat neck.


I finished my beer and Morrie jumped up, head bobbing, and got me another.


then I heard Mark’s voice again. “your writing reminds me a great deal of my own! ”


Morrie gave me the beer. I took a good hit and looked into the fire. a piece of wood cracked in the moment, a red spark broke off, shot up, fell back.


it was nice. it was nice and somehow reassuring.


“I’d like you to read a chapter from my novel,” Mark said. “do you have that blue folder, Morrie?”


Morrie had it. he placed it carefully on my lap.


I opened it, went to the first page


and began reading . . .


Mark couldn’t write, never could.


I read on, my teeth beginning to ache.


I asked Morrie,


222




“you got any whiskey?”


Morrie went for it as Mark sat straight up in Morrie’s old bathrobe, waiting for my words of praise.


I would find a way of letting him down easily


* hoped without lying.


the whiskey came and I gulped it down


went on reading


drinking


watching the fire.


Morrie’s head kept leaping.


why do some individuals never realize how wearisome they are?


or do they know and simply don’t


care?


* read on, hopeless-ly.


























223
overcast






I went to see my daughter.


she’s eleven and had just


taken a bath and she was getting


dressed in the closet so I


wouldn’t see her, and her


mother said, “you know, you like


to make this thing about your


women into a great big drama;


you love it, you love them


fighting and screaming over


you, you think it’s humorous,


don’t you?”


“now, baby . . .” I said.


“some day a woman is going to


put a knife into your heart,


you’re going to be killed and


while you’re dying you’re going


to say, ‘you stuck that thing


into me too far!’ ”


my daughter came out, fully


clothed, and I told her mother


that I’d bring her back in


3 hours.


about 4 miles away we found


a place to eat.


my daughter had a hamburger


sandwich and milk.


I had fried shrimp with


soup, fries, plus coffee.


224




we ate, I tipped the waitress,


I paid the cashier, then


we went out and got into my


car. it was a dark day, low


clouds, you couldn’t see any


sun. “your mother,” I told her


as we drove off, “is nothing


but a wiseass.”










































































225
the final word






always in the poem


we fall short.


ah,


to say the final word


you must


kill the fish,


throw away the


head and tail


(especially the eyes)


and eat the rest.


there is this hunger


to drive down the road


looking for it


in a 1998 Cadillac,


trees along the road,


* dung-spotted moon, and to run it down and get out and look at it,


hold it in your hand and look at it, examine it (especially the eyes) then throw it all away and


Cadillac off.


















226
fingernails; nostrils; shoelaces






the gas line is leaking, the bird is gone from the cage, the skyline is dotted with vultures;


Benny finally got off the stuff and Betty now has a job as a waitress; and


the chimney sweep was quite delicate as he giggled up through the soot.


I walked miles through the city and recognized nothing as a giant claw ate at my


stomach while the inside of my head felt airy as if I was about to go mad.


it’s not so much that nothing means anything but more that it keeps meaning nothing,


there’s no release, just gurus and self-appointed gods and hucksters.


the more people say, the less there is to say.


even the best books are dry sawdust.


I watch the boxing matches and take copious notes on futility.


then the gate springs open again


and there are the beautiful silks


and powerful horses riding


against the sky.


such sadness: everything trying to


break through into


blossom.


every day should be a miracle instead of a machination.


in my hand rests the last bluebird.


227




the shades roar like lions and the walls


rattle, dance around my


head.


then her eyes look at me, love breaks my


bones and I


laugh.

after receiving a contributor’s copy






carping little kettle-fish


griping over your wounds


found in these misprinted pages,


and still looking for sponsors


lovers


mothers


easy fame:


which one of you


did I see through a


frozen Denver restaurant window


eating apple pie?


which one of you


rode to East Hollywood on a bloodhound hunting your wet nurse? which one of you then knocked


on my door


wanting to talk about POETRY?


which one of you is vain enough


and miserable enough


and sick enough


to suck an editor’s ass?


which one of you goes


to all the lit parties


and reads his stuff to


tapeworms?


which one of you thinks


he’s Pound, or Shelley


on a blue butterfly?






229




which one of you


changed my poem to read


the way you THINK


a poem should read?


which one of you mewed in


sick, friendly sentiment


like larvae crawling the


body of my mind?


and this may seem strong


and unfair,


for I say let everyone live


and write


who wants to live and write,


but which one of you


lives with his mother or his aunt,


which one of you first


puts talcum on his butt


and then climbs up on


the cross?


which one of you


(one a university prof


I once chastised


for senseless abstraction)


which one of you now


writes about whores and drinking


and has never been to bed with a woman, and has never drunk


more than a small brown beer?






230




and which one of you


writes with a dictionary against his belly like buggering an unabridged cow?


which one of you grinds his soul


to Bach’s organ


like a monkey on a string?


which one of you


hates the wife that feeds you?


not because she’s human


but because


she doesn’t like your stuff.


which one of you


couldn’t hit a baseball?


which one of you


has never been in jail?


which one of you?


which one of you?


which one of


you?






























231
poor night






I think I’m in the first


dry period of my life.


nearing 62


one fears senility and


an end


to the luck.


I slowly drink


two large glasses of wine


and stare


at the white page.


it has always come so


easily.


I have always laughed at


writers who claimed that


creation was


painful.


I change stations


on the radio, pour


another wine.


“papa,” she opens the


door, “do you have any


matches?”


“sure,” I say and


hand her a couple of


books.


232




she leaves.


Henry Miller is dead.


Saroyan. Jeffers.


Nelson Algren.


They’ve all been dead now


for some time.


“papa,” she returns,


“this pen I’m using is


terrible. do you have


another pen?”


“sure,” I say and


hand her a good


one.


“there is too much smoke


in this room!”


she opens a window.


“you should let some of


the smoke out!”


“you’re right,”


I say.


she leaves


and I like her


concern


233




but then I am alone


with my blank page


again.


a) so then


I wrote this down to


fill in the blank


space.


2. then came the decision whether to tear it up or save it.


3. have


I done


the right thing?


















































234
you write many poems about death






yes, and here’s another one


and later it might even end up in one of my books.


and


the book will be sitting on a


shelf


waiting for you


long after I am


gone.


think of that:


in a sense I will be speaking again


just to you.


and remember this:


the page you are looking at


now,


I once typed the words


with care


with you in mind


under a yellow


light


with the radio


on.


if you think about death


long enough


I have found


it belongs


it makes sense


just like


235




this typewriter


this matchbook


this paper clip


and


the next page


and the next poem


after this


one.

the wisdom to quit


is all we have


left.


dog






is much admired by Man


because he believes in

him. a

setup. for


13 cents a


day you’ve got


a hired killer


who thinks


you are


God. a


dog can’t tell a Nazi from a


Republican from a Commie from


a Democrat. and, many times,


neither can I.

the hatred for Hemingway






I gave Hemingway’s last book


Islands in the Stream


a bad review


while most others gave him


good reviews.


but the hatred for Hemingway


by the unsuccessful writer


especially the female writer


is incomprehensible to me.


this unsuccessful female writer was in a rage.


I had tried to explain why I thought


Hemingway wrote as


he did.


that life-through-death bit, she said, is not at all unique with Hemingway. what else is our


whole Western culture about? it’s the same story


over and over


again. no news


there!


that’s true, I thought, but . . .


shooting lions only meant shooting himself? she asked. does it? does
it? not when those lions were unarmed and he was coming at them with a rifle and didn’t even have to


come close. really! poor little Heming-way.


240




it’s true, I thought, the lions don’t carry rifles.


the Spanish tradition. I can see Goya because he comes through as real and complete, she said. I can’t see Hemingway as anything but an old Hollywood movie
acted out by . . . what’s his name? that Cooper who was a friend of his—the High Noon guy. oh wow!


she doesn’t even like his friends,


I thought.


you learn about death by dying


not by looking at it,


she said.


that’s true, I thought, but then


how do you write about it?


you say Shakespeare bores you, she said— the fact is


he knew far more than Hemingway— Hemingway never got to be more than a journalist.


taught to write by Gertrude Stein, I thought.


he told you what he saw, she said, but he didn’t know what it meant—how things really relate . . . he never


explained.






241




that’s strange, I thought, that’s exactly what I


liked about


him.


you talk a lot of typical


crap, she said.


what a shame, I thought,


she has such long beautiful


legs. well, Goya was all right too,


but you can’t go to bed with


Goya.


well, all right, I thought, Hemingway pulled those big fish out of the sea and endured a few wars


and watched bulls die and shot some lions;


wrote some great short stories


and gave us 2 or 3


good early


novels;


on his last day


Hemingway waved to


some kids going to school,


they waved back, and he never touched the orange juice sitting there in front of him;


then he stuck that gun into his mouth like a soda straw and touched the trigger


and one of America’s few immortals


was blood and brain across the walls and ceiling, and then they all smiled, they smiled and said,


242




ah, a fag! ah, a coward!


yes, he took advantage of McAlmon


he took advantage of everybody


and he didn’t treat Fitzgerald right


and he typed standing up


and he was once in a mental


hospital,


and Gertie Stein, that friggin’


dyke,


maybe she did


teach him how to


write.


but who convinced him that it was time to die?


you did, you


dirty


fuckers.












































243
looking at the cat’s balls






sitting here by the window


sweating beer sweat


mauled by the summer


I am looking at the cat’s balls.


it’s not my choice.


he sleeps in an old rocker


on the porch


and from there he looks at me


hung to his cat’s balls.


there’s his tail, damned thing,


hanging out of the


way so I can


view his furry storage tanks but


what can a man think about


while looking at a cat’s nuts?


certainly not about the sunken navy after a great sea battle.


certainly not about a program to save the poor.


certainly not about a flower market or a dozen eggs.


certainly not about a broken light switch.


balls iz balls, that’s all,


and most certainly that’s true about a cat’s balls.


my own are rather soft and mushy and I’m told by my current lady quite large:


“you’ve got big balls, Chinaski!”


244




but the cat’s balls:


I can’t figure whether he’s hung to them or whether they’re hung to him.


you see, there is this almost nightly battle for the female


and it doesn’t come easy for either of us.


look:


a piece is missing from his left ear. once I thought one of his eyes had been clawed out


but when the dried


blood peeled away


a week later


there was his pure


gold-green eye


looking at me.


his entire body is scarred from bites and the other day, attempting to pet his head


he yowled and almost bit me—


the skin on his skull


had been split to reveal the bone.


it certainly doesn’t come easy for any of us, poor fellow.


he sleeps


now dreaming


what?


a fat mockingbird in his mouth?


or surrounded by female cats in heat?


245




he dreams his daydreams


and we’ll find out


tonight.


good luck, old fellow,


it doesn’t come easy,


hung to our balls we are, that’s it,


we’re captive to our balls,


and I should use a little restraint myself when it comes to the ladies. meanwhile I will


watch their eyes and lead with the left jab and run like hell


when it just isn’t any use


anymore.

on beer cans and sugar cartons






the ox, me,


I am cold tonight


this morning


4 a.m.


down to one can of beer and 2


cigars;


woman and child moving out


Wednesday;


the radio plays a Scottish air and


the old stove muffs out


gas, gas, gas,


if I could only sleep.


I can’t seem to sleep.


death doesn’t always arrive like a bomb or a fat whore


sometimes death crawls inch-by-inch


like a tiny spider crawling on your belly


while you


sleep.


this is not news to you,


I know that.


my skeleton hands pray tonight


pray for something


I don’t know


what.












249




my hands hold this cigar


over my emptied


dream.


I am


kind of like a dirty joke


told too often told too late


when people can no longer


laugh.


there is a box on the table.


I read its label, it says:


sugar measurements: 1 lb. powdered equals 4 and 3⁄4 cups sifted; 1 lb. granulated equals 2 and 1⁄2 cups, etc.


now, there’s a new world! I sit and leer at the box,


forgetting everything:


General Grant


pea soup


etc.


the ox, me, I am cold tonight.


tomorrow I will go to the grocery store and get empty cartons so they can pack up their


stuff. the woman saves all kinds of letters, ribbons, photographs. the little girl, of course, has her little girl toys.


I need more to read. I read my beer can. it says:


brewed of pure Rocky Mountain spring water






250




which turns to piss; brewed of flesh which turns into a meal for maggots;


brewed of love which turns to nothing; my land and your land; my grave and your grave; a taste of honey; a night’s dream of gold; I came this way for a while and then I left: brewed, screwed, borrowed, loaned and lied to in the name of Life.




I drink that beer.


I paid for


it.


it is now 5:30 a.m. and many people have fucked and slept and are now coming up out of their small dreams as the man on the radio asks me if I want to borrow money on my home.


I can sleep on that. I can sleep thinking


maybe the next time there are riots in the streets maybe they’ll let me join them


even though my skin is the wrong shade and while they are fighting for Cadillacs and color tvs


I’ll be fighting for something else—


just what


right now


isn’t clear to


me.


but maybe when I awaken it will all be clear.


251




right now


it’s stub out the cigar


wait for the grocery store to open and


change these dirty


shorts.




















































































252
pay your rent or get out






somewhere the dead princess


lies with a new lover;


I have only a few empty packs of


fags left


fished back out of nets of yearning


but everything is fine


except the color and demeanor


of the wasp,


the wax too red


and a note from the woman


on the hill


who buys my paintings:


“wondering about you. call


me. love, R.,”


and another note under the


door:


“pay your rent or get out.”


the heater is on and


there’s a pot of pure ground


pepper facing me,


and typewriter paper


to fill with poems;


everything is fine,


sidewalks echo the click of


heels,


engines start,


and I must wash these bloody


diseased coffee cups;


and I ask myself, how are you today, my friend?


how’s it going? disappointed?


unhappy?


253




me? it’s tough. tough as a


good poem,


but I feel all right,


and really,


essentially, pretty soon I am


going to eat


either hash or stew, something


out of a can.


I also may lift weights and I


hope


I keep feeling o.k., although my


radio is fuzzy


and speaks of silly things like


good jet service;


it is now 7:30, and this is the


way men


live and die: not Eliot’s way


but


my way, our way,


quietly as a folded wing,


hate burned out like a tube;


the drapes are coming down


torn by time


and there is a knife to my left that


couldn’t even cut an onion


but I don’t have any onions to


cut, and


I hope you are feeling


o.k. too.












254
note on a door knocker






yeah? I said, is that


so?


yes, he said, she lives in


Malibu, I’m going to see her


tonight.


ah, I said, has it been a


long-term relationship?


hell no, he said, I’m not a


masochist.


he fingered his gold chain


and talked about


poetry. he talked about poetry


for an


hour.


I’m not a masochist either, I said,


so will you get


the hell out of


here?


he left. but I knew he’d be


back.


he talked about


poetry. I wrote


it.


he couldn’t understand


that it and we


were not


alike.


255
the American Flag Shirt






now more and more


all these people running around wearing the American Flag Shirt and it was more or less once assumed (I think but I’m not sure)


that wearing an A.F.S. meant to


say you were pissing on


it


but now


they keep making them


and everybody keeps buying them


and wearing them


and the faces are just like


the American Flag Shirt—


this one has this face and that shirt that one has that shirt and this face— and somebody’s spending money and somebody’s making money and as the patriots become


more and more fashionable


it’ll be nice


when everybody looks around


and finds that they are all patriots now and therefore


who is there left to


persecute


except their


children?














256
age






the decency of sweating in a rocker is reserved for old generals or ancient statesmen as afternoons ripe with young girls who have nothing to do but laugh and walk by.


for me


when the fingers go the brain will go,


there will be nothing to lift the


glass and I will sit around thinking of


white nightgowns and hookers


and blocks of night with mice for eyes.


when the fingers fail the cup I have


failed


and the soul


in an old brown bag


will say goodbye


like hedges say goodbye


like cannons sit in parks wondering what next.




































257
the dogs bark knives






jesus christ the dogs bark knives


and on the elevators


tinkertoy men


decide my life and my death;


the falcons are cross-eyed


and there is nothing to save;


let us know the impossible


let us know that strong men die in packs, let us know that love is bought and kept like a pet dog—a dog that barks knives or a dog that barks love;


let us know that living out a life


among billions of idiots with molecule feelings is an art in itself;


let us know mornings and nights and perfidy;


let us be gone with the swallow


let us lynch the last hope


let us find the graveyard of elephants and the graveyard of the mad;
let those who sing songs of their own let them sing to the idiots and the liars and the planners of strategies in a game too dull for children;


there is only one way to live


and that is alone,


and only one way to die, and that the same; I’ve heard the marching of their armies all these years;


how tiresome—


what they want and what they’ve won; how tiresome that they are my masters


258




and will probably follow me into death bringing more death to death; the whole way is hollow—


I touch a small ring on my finger


and breathe the beaten


air.
















































































259
the hog in the hedge






you know, driving through this town or any town walking through this town or any town I see people with nostrils, fingers, feet,


eyes, mouths, ears, chins, eyebrows and so forth.


I go into a café, sit down and order breakfast,


look around and I am conscious of skulls and skele-


tons as I watch a man stick


a piece of bacon into his mouth and die a little


and I don’t like to contemplate death because


there might be someplace else we have to go later on


and I’ve had enough trouble right here just being right here but


maybe it’s the fault of all the snakes in glass cages, they can’t move, breathe or kill and they


ought to let them out and they ought to empty the jails too just as soon as I get my luger in order and my dogs unleashed.


the buildings are all poorly constructed and the human body is too; I sometimes watch dancers leaping about and I think, that’s ugly and awkward,


the human body is constructed wrong, it’s ungainly and stupid . . . compared to what? compared to the cactus and the leopard. well,


my women have always said, “you’re so negative!” and I’ve looked at them and replied, “I find real-ity negative.” compared to what? unreality.
yet for all that I have had more joy than any of


them, they were positive and depressed, and I am negative and happy. well,








260




it all could be the fault of firemen sitting around waiting


for a fire, it could be the fault of some guy in Moscow raping a 6-year-old girl, or it could be because fog is no longer fog the way it used to be—fresh, wet, cooling,


but everything’s hurting now. they found some guy playing football at U.C.L.A. who couldn’t read or write


but Christ he had strength, what a body, he might have slipped by but he got upset and murdered his drug dealer and they found out after all that he wasn’t much of a college boy, just kind of a kept goldfish which reminds me


hardly anybody keeps goldfish anymore; you know when I was a kid, one household out of 3 had goldfish. what happened to that? some even had


goldfish ponds in the backyard with slimy moss and dozens of goldfish, small, medium, large,


they lived on bread crumbs and some of those fuckers got so fat and stupid they just rose to the top and flattened out, one eye to the sun, quits, like a bad message from God, but people also quit when they shouldn’t.
once there


was a prizefighter, got $5 million for a championship fight,


the Macho Man, had never been defeated but he ran into


a guy who could handle him and after a few rounds he


turned his back and said,


“no mas.”


you’d figure for $5 million a man could stand a little


pain, I’ve watched men have their entire lives destroyed for


55 cents an hour or less.


well,


261




maybe it’s the masonry or maybe it’s the water pump, or maybe it’s the hog in the hedge, or maybe it’s the end of luck. angels are flying


low tonight with burning wings, your mother is the victim of her ordinary nightmares as 40 faucets drip, the cat has


leukemia, there are only 245 days left until Christmas, and my dental


technician hates me.


so now


I wake up with a stiff neck instead of a stiff


dick and


you


can always reach me here in


east Hollywood but


please please please


don’t


try.
















































262
I never bring my wife






I park, get out, lock the car, it’s a perfect day, warm and easy, I feel all right, I begin walking toward the entrance and a little fat guy joins me. he walks at my side. I don’t know where he came from. “hi,” he says, “how you doing?”


“o.k.,” I say.


he says, “I guess you don’t remember me. you’ve seen me maybe two or three times.”


“maybe so,” I say, “I’m at the track every day.”


“I come maybe three or four times a month,” he says.


“with your wife?” I ask.


“oh no,” he says, “I never bring my wife.” “who do you like in the first?” he asks.
I tell him that I haven’t bought my Racing Form yet.


we walk along and I walk faster. he struggles to keep up.


“where do you sit?” he asks.


I tell him that I sit in different places.


“that goddamned Gilligan,” he says, “is the worst jock here. I lost a bundle on him the other day. why do they use him?”


I tell him that Whittingham and Longden think he’s all right.


“sure, they’re friends,” he answers. “I know something about


Gilligan. want to hear it?”


I tell him to forget it.


we are nearing the newspaper stand near the entrance and I slant off toward it as if I was going to buy a paper.


“good luck,” I tell him and drift off.


263




he appears startled, his eyes look shocked, he reminds me


of a woman who feels secure only when somebody’s thumb is up her ass.


he looks around, spots a gray-haired old man with a


limp, rushes up, catches stride with the old guy and begins talking to him.


I pay my way in, find a seat far from everybody, sit down. I have seven or eight good quiet minutes, then I hear a movement: a young man has seated himself near me, not next to me but one seat away although there are hundreds of empty seats.


another Mickey Mouse, I think. why do they always find me?


I keep working at my figures.


then I hear his voice: “Blue Baron will take the feature.”


I make a note to scratch that dog and I look up and it seems that his remark was directed to me: there’s nobody else within fifty yards. I see his face.


he has a face women would love: utterly bland and blank.


he has remained almost untouched by circumstance, he’s a miracle of zero.


I gaze upon him, enchanted.


it’s like looking at a lake of milk


never rippled by even a pebble.


I look back down at my Form.


“who do you like?” he asked.


264




“sir,” I tell him, “I prefer not to talk.”


he looks at me from behind his perfectly trimmed black mustache, there is not one hair out of place;


I’ve tried mustaches; I’ve never cared enough for mirrors to keep a mustache looking that unnatural.


he says, “I’ve heard about you. you don’t like to talk to anybody.”


I get up, take my papers, walk three rows down and sixteen seats over. I go to my last resort, take out my red rubber earplugs, jam them in.


being my brother’s keeper would only narrow me down to a brick-walled place


where everything is the same.


I feel for the lonely, I sense their need, but I also feel that the lonely are for one another and that they should find each other and leave me alone.


so, plugs in, I miss the flag-raising ceremony, being deep into the Form.


I would like to be human


if only they would let me.


going to the track is like going anywhere else except, generally speaking,


there are more lonely people there, which doesn’t help. they have a right to be there and I have a right to be there. this is a democracy and we are all part of one unhappy family.

an interview at 70






the interviewer leans toward


me, “some say that you are not


as wild as you used to


be.”


“well,” I say, “I can’t keep on


forever writing poems about


spilling beer into the laps of


whores.


a man matures and moves on to other things.”


“but some still want the same


old Chinaski!”


“and that’s just what they’ve


got,” I say.


“tell us about the


racetrack,” he suggests.


“there’s nothing to


tell.”


“you have to wait


until he gets mellow


until after midnight


to hear the really good


stuff,”


says my wife.












266




the interviewer is not


used to waiting.


he stares at his


notes.


he wants some


grand statements, some


grand conclusions,


something grand to


happen now.


he is confused by his


misconceptions and


preconceptions.


and the worst thing


about him?


he’s not


wild


enough.

my friend says, how can you write so many poems from that window? I write from the womb, he tells me. the dark thing of pain,


the featherpoint of pain.


well, this is very impressive


only I know that we both receive a good many


rejections, smoke a great many cigarettes,


drink too much and attempt to steal each other’s


women, which is not poetry at all.


and he reads me his poems


he always reads me his poem


and I listen and do not say too much, I look out of the window, and there is the same street


my street


my drunken, rained-on, sunned-on, childrened-on street,


and at night I watch this street


sometimes


when it thinks I am not looking,


the 1 or 2 cars moving quietly,


the same old man, still alive, on his


nightly walk,


the shades of houses down,


love has failed but


hangs on


then lets go.


but now it is daylight and children


who will some day be old men and women walking through last moments,


268




these children run around a red car


screaming their good nothings,


then my friend puts down his poem.


well, what do you think? he asks.


try so and so, I name a magazine,


and then oddly


I think of guitars under the sea


trying to play music;


it is sad and good and quiet.


he sees me standing at the window.


what’s out there?


look, I say,


and see . . .


he is eleven years younger than I.


he turns away from the window. I need a beer, I’m out of beer.


I walk to the refrigerator


and the subject is closed.

van Gogh and 9 innings






the battleship nights in Georgia


when we all


went down.


do you know? there was this Russian who leaped to music well enough to make you cry and he went insane


and they put him someplace and fed him and


shocked him with electric wires and cold water and then


hot water and he wrote books about himself


he couldn’t read or


remember.


out at the ball game


in Atlanta


I watched them hurrying, sweating, and I sat there thinking about the


Dutchman


(instead of the Russian)


the Dutchman with the toothbrush stroke


who never learned to properly mix his paints and who couldn’t make even a whore love him


and it all ended then


for him and for the whore


and he cut off his ear and continued to beg for paints


and they write books about him


now


270




but he’s dead and can’t read them


and I saw some of his stuff at a


gallery,


last year—they had it roped off and


guarded so you couldn’t touch the


work.


somebody won that ball game in Atlanta and the whore


didn’t want his


ear.

9 a.m.






blazing as a fort blazes


this first impromptu note—


sunlight—


foul betrayer


breaking through kisses and perfume and nylon, showing a city of broken teeth and insane laws,


bringing a ruined alley to the eye,


this diamond in the rough;


and inside my palm


a small sore


berry-red


that even Christ w’d n’t ignore


as the ladies pass


shifting their rotted gears


and peppermint fences and spoiled dogs


blazing as


you burn;


9 a.m. sunlight


gives us apples and whores


and now thankfully


I can again remember


when I was young


when I walked in gold


when rivers had mirrors


and there was no end.

lousy day






in the old days


after the races I would often end up with a high yellow or a crazy white in some motel room


but now I’m 70 and have to get up four times each night to piss


and about the only thing that really concerns me is freeway traffic.


today I dropped $810.00 at the track and when I tried to enter the freeway a


guy in a red Camaro almost ran me


off the road (red automobiles have always annoyed me) so I swung after him, rode his
bumper hard, then swung around and we rode side-by-side.


looking over at him I saw he was a slight young boy who looked like a cost accountant, so I ran my window down and screamed at him while honking, informing him that he was a piece
of subnormal dung but he just continued to stare straight ahead so I hit the gas and left him behind and my next thought was, I wonder if I should tell my wife about this?


and then quickly a voice from somewhere answered, don’t be a sucker, pal, she’ll just turn it into an unflattering joke.


“oh, hahaha! he probably didn’t even know you were there!”


if a man lives for 70 years he learns


one or two things—the first being: don’t confide unnecessarily


273




in your wife.


the second being: others may sometimes understand you but


none of them will understand you


better than your wife


does.

sadness in the air






here I am alone sitting


like some wimp


listening to Chopin


the night wind blowing in


through the


torn curtains.


won $546 at the track today but


now I’m thinking that


dying is such a strange and


ordinary thing.


I just hope that I’ll never need


false teeth before I


go.

Wm. Holden cracked his head


on a coffee table


while drunk and


bled to death;


stiff and dead for 4 days


before they found him.


I wonder how Chopin went?


things pass away, that’s not


news.








275




here in L.A.


I’ve seen so many good


Mexican fighters


come and go


climbing through the


ropes


young and glistening with


ambition


and then


vanish.


where do they go?


where are they tonight


as I listen to Chopin?


maybe I’m in a better


business?


I don’t think so.


writers go fast


too


they forget how to lead


with a


straight hard sentence


then they teach class


write critical articles


bitch


get stale


vanish.

Holden slipped on a


throw rug


his head hitting the


nightstand


he had a .22 alcohol


blood count.


myself


I’ve gone down


many times usually


over a telephone cord.


I hate telephones


anyhow


whenever one rings


I jump.


people ask, “why do you


jump when the telephone


rings?”


if they don’t know


you can’t tell them.


.•        •        •


it’s getting cold.


I go to shut the window.


I do.


Chopin continues.




277




when you drink alone


like Wm. Holden


sometimes you’ve got


something on your mind


that you can’t tell


anybody.


in many cases it’s


better to keep


silent.


we were not put here to


enjoy easy days and


nights


and when the telephone


rings


you too will know that


we’re all


in the wrong business


and if you don’t know


what that means


you don’t feel the


sadness in the air.

the great debate






he sent me his latest book.


I had once liked his writing


very much.


he had been wonderfully crude, simple, troubled.


now he had learned how to gracefully arrange his words and thoughts on paper.


now he taught courses at the


universities.


but I wondered about


what?


his words were now


very pale.


they spread across the page


like a mist


filling it


but saying


very little.


he didn’t seem to be the


same man.


where had he gone?












279




why do


such deaths seem


mysterious?


it’s well that


new poets come along


new quarterbacks


new matadors


new dictators


new revolutionaries


new butchers


new pawnbrokers.


because spiritual death arrives


much more quickly and unexpectedly than physical demise.


I drop his new book


into the wastebasket.


I don’t want it


around.


he was now a


successful writer


which meant


that his work


no longer made


anybody


angry


disgusted


or sad.








280




never made


anybody


laugh


never made


anybody


feel that rush of wonder


while reading


it.


but in a world


where even


the disappearance


of the dinosaur


remains a mystery


we should accept


the mysterious fact of


the vanishing poet.


and when we accept


that


we are simply


making way for


our own final


invisibility.
























281
our deep sleep






I’ve always been a sucker for the


old ones: Céline, Hemingway, Dreiser, Sherwood Anderson, e. e. cummings,
Jeffers, Auden, W. C. Williams, Wallace Stevens, Pound, D. H. Lawrence, Carson McCullers . . . and some others.


Our current moderns


leave me quite


unsatisfied.


there is neither lean nor


fat in their efforts, no pace,


no gamble, no joy.


it’s work reading them, hard


work,


there is much pretense


and even some clever con


behind their productions.


I have no idea what has


happened to the creative


writer since the 1940s.


there has been a half century


of utter pap.


why?


I don’t know.


I don’t know.


there has been little to


read


for some time now.


I have been able to


282




read only the newspapers


and the


Racing Form.


all those books printed,


a million books


printed


and nothing to


read.


a half century shot to


shit.


we deserve nothing


and that’s what we have


now.

the sorry history of myself






this is a terrible way to live:


surrounded by


the ever-


irascible,


coldhearted and


nearly mad.


but my early experiences were


quite similar.


I should be adjusted to it


all by now


from my angry boiling


petty father


to


the slew of females


who came later


all consumed by


depression,


useless rage,


screeching and


nonsensical


self-


pity.


happiness and simple joy


for them all seemed to be


simply diseases to be


eradicated.






284




this history of


myself:


this terrible way to


live.


but I feel I have now snatched


victory


from all the useless


raging black


hysteria.


I have now survived all


that and


they can club me with their


angry lives and


burn me on my


deathbed


but somehow


I have found a lasting


peace


they can never


take


away.

law






look, he told me,


all those little children dying in the trees,


and I said, what?


and he said, look,


and I went to the window


and sure enough, there they were hanging in the trees, dead and dying,


and I said, what does it mean?


and he said, I don’t know but it’s been authorized.


the next day when I got up


they had dogs in the trees


dead and hanging and dying,


and I turned to my friend and said, what does it mean?


and he said, don’t worry about it,


it’s the way of things, they took a vote, it was decided,


and the next day it was cats,


I don’t see how they caught all those cats so fast and hung them in the trees but they did,


and the next day it was horses and that wasn’t so good because many branches broke,


and after bacon and eggs the next day my friend pulled the pistol on me over the coffee and said, let’s go,


and we went outside


and there were all these men and women in the trees, most of them dead or


dying, and he got the rope ready, and I said, what does it mean? and he said, don’t worry,


286




it’s been authorized, it’s constitutional, it passed by majority vote, and he tied my hands behind my back, then opened the noose.


I don’t know who’s going to hang me, he said, when I get done with you. I suppose, finally, there’ll be just one of us left and he’ll have to hang


himself.


suppose he doesn’t? I asked.


he has to, he said, it’s been authorized.


o, I said, well, let’s get on


with it


then.




























































287
a great writer






a great writer remains in bed


shades down


doesn’t want to see anyone


doesn’t want to write anymore


doesn’t want to try anymore;


the editors and publishers wonder:


some say he’s insane


some say he’s dead;


his wife now answers all the mail:


“. . . he does not wish to . . .”


and some others even walk up and down outside his house,


look at the pulled-down


shades;


some even go up and ring the


bell.


nobody answers.


the great writer does not want to be disturbed. perhaps the great writer is not in? perhaps the great writer has gone away?


but they all want to know the truth, to hear his voice, to be told some good reason for it all.


if he has a reason


he does not reveal it.


perhaps there isn’t any


reason?








288




strange and disturbing arrangements are made; his books and paintings are quietly auctioned off;


no new work has appeared now for


years.


yet his public won’t accept his


silence—


if he is dead


they want to know; if he is


insane they want to know; if he has a reason, please tell us!


they walk past his house


write letters


ring the bell


they cannot understand and will not accept


the way things are.


I rather like


it.

a gigantic thirst






I’ve been on antibodies for almost 6 months, baby, to cure a case of TB, man, leave it to an old guy like me to catch such an old-fashioned disease, catch it big as a basketball or like a boa constrictor swallowing a gibbon; so now I’m on antibodies and been told not to
drink


or smoke for 6 months, and talk about biting iron with your


teeth, I’ve been drinking and smoking heavily and steadily with the best


and the worst of them for over 50 years, yeah,


and the most difficult part, pard, I know too many people who drink and smoke and they just go right on drinking and smoking in


front of me like


I’m not aching to crack their skulls and roll them on the floor or just chase them the hell away out of my sight—a sight which longs very much for anything even microscopically addictive. the next hardest part is sitting at the typewriter without it,
I mean, that’s been my show, my dance, my entertainment, my


raison d’être, yep, mixing smoke and booze with the typer and you’ve got a parlay there where the luck rains down night and day and in
between, and


you hear the phrase “cutting it cold turkey” but I don’t think that’s strong enough, it should be “chopping it cold turkey” or “burying the
turkey


warm,” anyhow it hasn’t been easy, no no no no no no no no no no, and when I look at a bottle of beer


it looks like bottled sunlight, a smoke is like the breath of life and a bottle of red wine looks like the blood of life itself.
















290




for me, it’s hard to think or worry about the future: the immediate present seems too overwhelming and now I sympathize with all those
who fail


to curb their drinking and their smoking


because these last 6 months have been the longest 6 months of my life!


forgive me for boring you with all this but isn’t that why you’re here?

eulogies






after death


we exaggerate a person’s good qualities, inflate them.


during life


we are often repulsed by that same person


while talking to them on the telephone


or just being with them in the same room.


and we are often critical of the way they


walk, talk, dress


live


believe


but let them die


then what creatures they


become.


if only at a funeral service


somebody would say,


“what an odious individual


that one was!”


even at my funeral


let there be a bit of truth,


then the good clean


dirt.


















292
a residue






stuck in mid-flight,


wickedly sheared,


dreaming of the


dactylozoid.


turned away,


fashioned to stop


on zero,


flamed out,


hacked at,


demobilized.


where is common


laughter?


simple joy?


where did they


go?


what a vanishing


trick,


that.


even the skies


snarl.


what rancor,


what


bitterness . . .


the cry of the


smothered


heart,


now


293




remembering


better


times


wild and


wondrous.


now the sad


grim


present


cleaves.

1990 special






year-worn


weary to the bone,


dancing in the dark with the


dark,


the Suicide Kid gone


gray.


ah, the swift summers


over and gone


forever!


is that death


stalking me


now?


no, it’s only my cat,


this


time.

passage






and their ships burned, galleon and galley sail, and they drowned as the clouds came down like kings from thrones and held them: servants, slaves, lions, sages, fools, merchants, murderers; then the kelp, bitumen, alabaster, seashells held court, and then came the shadows,


dark as walls under a dying sun: and bellicose and vicious the sea pounded the sinking ships and the weeds cradled the skulls in disquisition, the


sea kelp held the skulls up and you saw them then, so odd and free and casual: all the lonely lovers dead.






























































296
a most dark night in April






each man finally trapped and broken


each grave ready


each hawk killed


and love and luck too.


the poems have ended


the throat is dry.


I suppose there’s no funeral for this


and no tears


and no reason.


pain’s the master


pain is silent.


the throats of my poems


are dry.

sun coming down






no one is sorry I am leaving,


not even I;


but there should be a minstrel


or at least a glass of wine.


it bothers the young most, I think:


an unviolent slow death.


still it makes any man dream;


you wish for an old sailing ship,


the white salt-crusted sail


and the sea shaking out hints of immortality.


sea in the nose


sea in the hair


sea in the marrow, in the eyes


and yes, there in the chest.


will we miss


the love of a woman or music or food or the gambol of the great mad muscled horse, kicking clods and destinies high and away


in just one moment of the sun coming down?


but now it’s my turn


and there’s no majesty in it


because there was no majesty


before it


and each of us, like worms bitten


out of apples,


deserves no reprieve.








298




death enters my mouth


and snakes along my teeth


and I wonder if I am frightened of


this voiceless, unsorrowful dying that is like the drying of a rose?
