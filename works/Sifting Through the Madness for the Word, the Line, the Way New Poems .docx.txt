why is it that the pickup truck


carrying the loose refrigerator


on the freeway


is always going between


80 and 90 m.p.h.?


so you want to be a writer?


if it doesn’t come bursting out of you in spite of everything, don’t do it.


unless it comes unasked out of your


heart and your mind and your mouth


and your gut,


don’t do it.


if you have to sit for hours


staring at your computer screen


or hunched over your


typewriter


searching for words,


don’t do it.


if you’re doing it for money or


fame,


don’t do it.


if you’re doing it because you want


women in your bed,


don’t do it.


if you have to sit there and


rewrite it again and again,


don’t do it.


if it’s hard work just thinking about doing it, don’t do it.


if you’re trying to write like somebody else,


forget about it.


if you have to wait for it to roar out of you,
then wait patiently.


if it never does roar out of you,


do something else.




3


if you first have to read it to your wife or your girlfriend or your boyfriend or your parents or to anybody at all, you’re not ready.


don’t be like so many writers,


don’t be like so many thousands of


people who call themselves writers,


don’t be dull and boring and


pretentious, don’t be consumed with self-


love.


the libraries of the world have


yawned themselves to


sleep


over your kind.


don’t add to that.


don’t do it.


unless it comes out of


your soul like a rocket,


unless being still would


drive you to madness or


suicide or murder,


don’t do it.


unless the sun inside you is


burning your gut,


don’t do it.


when it is truly time,


and if you have been chosen,


it will do it by


itself and it will keep on doing it


until you die or it dies in


you.

there is no other way.


and there never was.






























































































5
my secret life


as a child


* suppose


* was not quite normal.


my happiest times were


when


I was left alone in


the house on a


Saturday.


there was a large


old-fashioned


stand-up


Victrola


in the front


room.


you wound it


up with a


handle on the


right-hand


side.


my favorite time


of the day


was late


afternoon.


it was shady then,


it was


quiet.


I’d take out all the


phonograph records




6


and spread them


out on the floor


around the


room.


I preferred the


ones with the dark


purple


label.


I only played


those.


but I didn’t really like


the


music


very


much.


I’d hold my finger


against the spinning


record


and slow down the


sound.


I liked that


better.


I played all the


records with the


purple label


over and over,


slowing down the


sound.






7


as I slowed the


music down,


interesting things


happened in my


head


but they were


momentary:


I would see a


waterfall, then it


would quickly


vanish.


or I would see


my father putting


on his leather


slippers in the


morning


or a


tiger killing


something.


I kept seeing


brief glimpses


of many things


before they


vanished


but sometimes


I’d see


nothing unusual,


just the purple


label


revolving


revolving




8


and I’d attempt to


read the print


as the record


turned.


finally I would put


all the records


carefully


away


and I would


rewind the


machine


and watch the


turntable


spin.


it was covered


with green


felt


and I would


alter the speed


of the turntable


by holding my


finger against


it.


after that,


I would go to


the front window


and peek through the


drapes at the lady


across the street.


she sat on the


front steps




9


of her house


most of the day,


her legs crossed


as she smoked


her cigarettes.


she spoke to our


neighbors as they


walked by and


she had long silken


legs.


she laughed often


and seemed


happy:


she was not


at all


like my


mother.


I’d watch her for


* long time.
I’d watch her until she went back into her house.


next was the


clock on the


mantel.


it had a large


sweeping


second


hand.




10


then the contest


would


begin:


me against the


second


hand.


I would position


myself on the


floor


so that I could


watch


the second


hand.


I would wait until


it touched the


twelve,


then I would


hold my


breath.


I would hold


it as long as


possible,


timing


myself.


then I would


begin


again,


holding my


breath


in an attempt




11


to hold it


longer than


I was able to


the last


time.


I would note the


time that had passed,


then I would


begin once again


in an


attempt to


better that


time.


each time


I would


be able to hold


my breath


* little longer.


but it became


more and more


difficult.


I’d hear an


excited announcer’s


voice:


“THIS TIME, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THERE WILL SURELY BE A






12


NEW WORLD’S


RECORD!”


it got hard,


it got very hard,


holding my breath,


but the world


record was


important.


I could no longer


just lie there


holding it


in,


I had to clench


my fists


and roll about on


the rug.


I’d close my eyes


while


flashes of light


exploded inside


my head,


explosions of color,


red, blue,


purple!


at last,


I’d breathe


in and


look at the


clock:






13


I HAD SET A NEW


WORLD’S RECORD


15 SECONDS LONGER


THAN THE OLD


ONE!


then I’d get


up,


go into the


kitchen and drink


a glass of


water.


I always drank a


glass of water,


then.


I don’t know


why.


soon after that


my parents would


come home,


first my mother,


then my


father.


my mother wouldn’t


say much,


she’d be busy in


the kitchen,


but my father


always had something


to say


and it was always




14


the


same:


“well, Henry, what


have you been doing


all day?”


“nothing.”


“nothing? what the


hell kind of answer is


that?”


I wouldn’t reply,


not to him,


he would never


know,


I’d die before I


would tell him


anything,


he could kill me


before I’d tell


him.


him and his shoes,


him and his ears,


him and his hairy


arms.


whatever it was


* had done,
it belonged only to me.


15
the column


to avoid the inexplicable had always been a necessity for me.


and so this day in 1942


I was 21 years old


sitting on a park bench


with and like the


other bums


when the war chariots


rolled by


soldiers on their way


to war


and the soldiers saw


me


hated me


began yelling and cursing


at me


asking me what the hell I


thought I was doing there!


I was the only young bum


in the park.


the soldiers wanted me to be going with them.


the whole column of them


screamed and cursed at


me




16


as they drove


by.


then the column was


gone and the old bum


next to me


asked, “how come you


ain’t in the Service,


son?”


I got up and walked


down to the library.


I went inside


found a book and


sat down


at a table.


I began to read


the book.


the meaning was


too deep


for me


then.


so I put it


back on the shelf


walked back outside


and waited.
















17
commerce


I used to drive those trucks so hard and for so long that my right foot would


go dead from pushing down on the accelerator.


delivery after delivery,


14 hours at a time


for $1.10 per hour


under the table,


up one-way alleys in the worst parts of town.


at midnight or at high noon, racing between tall buildings always with the stink of something dying or about to die in the freight elevator


at your destination,


a self-operated elevator,


opening into a large bright room,


uncomfortably so


under unshielded lights


over the heads of many women


each bent mute over a machine,


crucified alive


on piecework,


to hand the package then


to a fat son of a bitch in red


suspenders.


he signs, ripping through the cheap paper


with his ballpoint pen,


that’s power,


that’s America at work.




18


you think of killing him


on the spot


but discard that thought and


leave,


down into the urine-stinking


elevator,


they have you crucified too,


America at work,


where they rip out your intestines


and your brain and your


will and your spirit.


they suck you dry, then throw


you away.


the capitalist system.


the work ethic.


the profit motive.


the memory of your father’s words, “work hard and you’ll be appreciated.”


of course, only if you make


much more for them than they pay you.


out of the alley and into the


sunlight again,


into heavy traffic,


planning the route to your next stop, the best way, the time-saver,


you knowing none of the tricks


and to actually think about


all the deliveries that still lie ahead would lead to


19


madness.


it’s one at a time,


easing in and out of traffic


between other work-driven drivers


also with no concept of danger,


reality, flow or


compassion.


you can feel the despair


escaping from their


machines,


their lives as hopeless and


as numbed as


yours.


you break through the cluster


of them


on your way to the next


stop,


driving through teeming downtown Los Angeles in 1952, stinking and hungover,


no time for lunch,


no time for coffee,


you’re on route #10,


a new man,


give the new man the


ball-busting route,


see if he can swallow the


whale.


you look down and the


needle is on


red.




20


almost no gas left.


too fucking bad.


you gun it,


lighting a crushed cigarette with


one hand from a soiled pack of


matches.


shit on the world.














































































21
the Mexican fighters


watching the boxing matches from Mexico on tv while sitting in bed


on a cool November evening.


had a great day at the track, picking 7 of 9, two of them long shots.


no matter, I am watching the fighters


work hard now, showing more courage than style


as in the front row two fat men talk to each other,


paying no attention to the


boxers


who are fighting for their very existence as human beings.


sitting in bed here, I feel sad for everybody, for all the struggling people everywhere, trying to get the rent paid on time, trying to get enough food, trying to get an easy night’s sleep.


it’s all very wearing and it doesn’t stop until you die.


what a circus, what a show, what a


farce


from the Roman Empire to the French-Indian War, and from there to here!


now, one of the Mexican boys has


floored the other.


the crowd is screaming.


the boy is up at 9.


he nods to the referee that he is


ready to go again.


the fighters rush together.




22


even the fat men in the front row are excited now.


the red gloves fiercely punch the air and the faces and the hard brown bodies.




then


the boy is down again.


he is flat on his back.


it’s over.


the god-damned thing is over.


for that boy, there is no knowing where he is going now.


for the other boy, it’s going to be good for a little while.


he smiles in tune with the


world.


I flick off the tv.


after a moment I hear gunshots off somewhere in the distance.


the contest of life continues.


I get up, walk to the window.


I feel disturbed, I mean about


people and things, the way of


things.


then I’m sitting back on the bed, with many feelings passing through me that I can’t quite


23


comprehend.


then I force myself to stop thinking.


some questions don’t have answers.


what the hell, I had 7 for 9 at the track today, that’s something


even in the midst of a lot of


nothing.


what you do is take whatever luck comes your way and pretend


you know more than you ever


will.


right?




























































24
this dog


look at this place! stockings and shorts and trash all over the floor! you just don’t want to be responsible! to you a woman is nothing but something


for your convenience! you just sit there slurping up everything I do for you!


why don’t you say something?


this is your place so you have to listen! if I was talking to you like this at my place you’d walk right out the door!


why are you smiling?


is something funny?


all you do is slurp up all my love and caring and then go to the racetrack! what’s so great about a horse?


what’s a horse got that I haven’t got?


four legs?


aren’t you bright?


aren’t you funny?


now aren’t you the thing?


you act like nothing matters!


well, let me tell you something, asshole, I matter! you think you’re the only man in this town? well, let me tell you, there are plenty of men who want me, my body, my mind, my spirit!


many people have asked me, “what are you doing with a person like him?”


25


what?


no, I don’t want a drink!


I want you to realize what’s happening to our relationship before it’s too late!


look at you still slurping all this up!


you think you’re so wonderful!


you know what happens to you when you drink too much?


I might as well be living with a eunuch!


my mother warned me!


everybody warned me!


look at you now!


why don’t you try to communicate?


why don’t you shave?


you’ve spilled wine all over the front of your shirt!


and that cheap cigar!


you know what that thing smells


like?


like horseshit!


hey, where are you going?


to some bar, to some stinking bar! you’ll sit there nursing your self-pity with all those other losers!


if you go out through that door I’m going out dancing!


I’ll go meet a new man!


I’ll go have some fun!






26


if you go out that door, then it’s over between us forever!


all right, go on then, you asshole!


asshole!


asshole!


ASSHOLE!








































































27
the great escape


listen, he said, you ever seen a bunch of crabs in a bucket?


no, I told him.


well, what happens is that now and then one crab will climb up on top of the others


and begin to climb toward the top of the bucket, then, just as he’s about to escape


another crab grabs him and pulls him back down.


really? I asked.


really, he said, and this job is just like that, none of the others want anybody to get out of here. that’s just the way it is in the postal service!


I believe you, I said.


just then the supervisor walked up and said, you fellows were talking.


there is no talking allowed on this


job.


I had been there eleven and one-half years.


I got up off my stool and climbed right up the supervisor
and then I reached up and pulled myself right out of there.


it was so easy it was unbelievable.


but none of the others followed me.










28


and after that, whenever I had crab legs I thought about that place.


I must have thought about that place maybe 5 or 6 times


before I switched to lobster.

a quick one


in 5 minutes I am going


to get into my


jacuzzi


but first please take


a picture of this:


* 70-year-old white whale lurking within the warm white whirling water.


how did he last?


how did he escape


all the harpoons


for all those years?


why didn’t he get beached


along the way


on the dry


shore?


how did he evade so many


schools of hungry


sharks?


now see this:


his little eyes peering just


above the bubbling


water . . .


what a miracle!


life is full of happy


miracles


here in the cool dark


winter evening.




30


in the stratosphere


the jealous gods shiver


and moan


while


the white whale floats


blissfully


in the warm white


water


where it’s always


104. degrees


of


heaven on earth.

the old anarchist


my neighbor gives me the key to his house when he goes on vacation.


I feed his cats


water his flowers and his


lawn.


I place his mail in a neat stack


on his dining room table.


am I the same man who planned to blow up the city of Los Angeles 15 years ago?


I lock his door.


I walk down his front walk


pause


stretch a moment


in the sunset thinking,


there’s still time,


there’s still time for a


comeback.


I have never belonged with


these others.


I walk down the sidewalk


toward my place


being careful


not to step


on the cracks.










32
and I still won’t vote


10 boxes of crackerjack left over from Halloween.


I give them to the gardeners.


I am the great man on this plantation.


I bring beer to the workers.


they play their transistor radios


listen to the crap music


in the sun.


they suck at their beer,


break open the boxes of


Crackerjack.


they chew


rotting their mouths and their brains as I phone my financial adviser at Salomon Brothers.


he says, copper, put it into


copper.


I’ll consider that, I tell him.


I hang up, walk out on the


balcony, watch the men in the 98-degree heat.


“you’re doing a great job, fellows!”


a nice bright-eyed fellow up near the


front


asks,




33


“do you want us to do the planting too?”


“no, you fellows do the shit work, I’ll do the planting, I’ll take the glory.”


they don’t laugh.


I wave, walk back inside.


then I feel the need to excrete.


I ponder whether to use


the front crapper


the back crapper


or


the upstairs crapper.


I decide on the upstairs crapper, walk up the marble stairway thinking, it has taken you sixty years, Chinaski, to finally plunder the American economic system.














































34
just trying to do a good deed


she was right when she told me, “you only go with my sister because she’s younger than I am. you’re prejudiced against older people and dislike fat women.”


“when’s she coming home?” I asked her. “where is she?”


“don’t worry about her, I’m talking to you now.
tell me, what’s wrong with me?”


“you’re too old and you’re fat,” I told her.


“but so are you,” she said.


“I’m not fat,” I said.


“you’re overweight,” she said.


“all right, stop bitching, come on,


we’ll fuck.”


“what did you say?”


“you heard me.”


we sat there without speaking then. I nodded toward the bedroom a few times but she just sat there.






35


suddenly the door opened and the younger sister appeared. the fat sister jumped up.


she pointed to me.


“HE WANTED TO FUCK ME!”


the younger sister looked at me.


“is this true?”


“no,” I said, “I didn’t want to.”


“BUT HE OFFERED TO!” screamed the older sister.


“well?” the younger sister asked me.


“it’s true,” I said.


“YOU GET OUT OF MY HOUSE!”


I got up and walked out the door


and across the sidewalk to my


car.


“I TOLD YOU HE WAS NO GOOD!” I heard the fat sister scream.


“OH, SHUT UP!” I heard the younger sister scream.






36


I got into my car and drove


away.


when I got to my place the phone


was ringing.


I picked it up, hung it up,


then took it off the


hook.


better to be safe than


sorry.








































































37
one step removed


I knew a lady who once lived with Hemingway.


I knew a lady who claimed to have screwed Ezra Pound. Sartre invited me to visit him in Paris but I was too stupid to accept.


Caresse Crosby of Black Sun Press wrote me from Italy. Henry Miller’s son wrote that I was a better writer than his father.


I drank wine with John Fante.


but none of this matters at all except in a romantic sort of way.


some day they’ll be talking about me:


“Chinaski wrote me a letter.”


“I saw Chinaski at the racetrack.” “I watched Chinaski wash his car.” all absolute nonsense.


meanwhile, some wild-eyed young man alone and unknown in a room


will be writing things that will make you forget everybody else


except maybe the young man to


follow after


him.




































38
my life as a sitcom


stepped into the wrong end of the jacuzzi and twisted my


right leg which was bad to begin with, then that night got drunk with a tv writer and an actor, something about using my


life to make a sitcom and luckily that fell through and the next day at the track I get a box seat in the dining area, get a menu and a glass of water, my leg is really paining me, I


can barely walk to the betting window and back, then about the 3rd race the waiter rushes by, asks, “can I borrow your menu?” but he doesn’t wait for an answer, he just grabs it and runs off.


a couple of races go by, I fight through my pain and continue to make my bets, get back, sit down just as the waiter rushes by again. he grabs all my silverware and my napkin and runs off. “HEY!” I yell but he’s gone.


all around me people are eating, drinking and laughing.


I check my watch after the 6th race and it is 4:30 p.m.


I haven’t been served yet and I’m 72 years old with a hangover and a leg from hell.


I pull myself to my feet by the edge of the table and manage to hobble about looking for the maitre d’. I see him down a far aisle and wave him in.


“can I speak to you?” I ask.


“certainly, sir!”


“look, it’s the 7th race, they took my menu and my silver-ware and I haven’t been served yet.” “we’ll take care of it right away, sir!”


well, the 7th race went, the 8th race went, and still no service.


I purchase my ticket for the 9th race and take the escalator down.


on the first floor, I purchase a sandwich.


I eat it going down another escalator to the parking lot.


the valet laughs as I slowly work my leg into the




39


car, making a face of pain as I do so.


“got a gimpy leg there, huh, Hank?” he asks.


I pull out, make it to the boulevard and onto the freeway which immediately begins to slow down because of a 3-car crash ahead.


I snap on the radio in time to find that my horse has run out in the 9th.


a flash of pain shoots up my right leg. I decide to tell my wife about my misfortunes at the track


even though I know she will respond by telling me that everything as always was completely my fault


but when a man is in pain he can’t think right,


he only asks for


more.


and


gets it.

a mechanical Lazarus


I don’t know how long I’ve had this IBM Selectric typewriter: 12 years maybe: it’s typed thousands of poems, dozens of short stories, two or three novels and a screenplay.


I’ve spilled beer, wine,


whiskey, vodka, ale plus


cigarette and cigar ash


into it


with never a breakdown.


and I don’t know how many hours


of classical music we’ve listened


to together.


the nights have always been


long and good


with always the promise of


laughter behind our most


serious


moments.


then I received a computer for


Christmas.


I mean, we must keep up with the


times. no?


after all, the old manual standard that preceded the electric typewriter now sits downstairs


in dignified retirement




41


and we too have shared many


magical and crazy


nights.


I mean, men once wrote with


quill pens.


we must move on.


so I cleared the desk off for the new computer.


then I pulled the plug on the


electric, covered it and


carried it over to the corner


of the room and set it


down.


that was the worst part—carrying it off like that.


it was like it was something alive.


I half expected it to speak,


as it often had, in its own


way.


I felt as if I had turned a pet


dog out into the cold


street.


then my daughter


who is a computer whiz


came over to set things up




42


for me and to show me


the basic techniques.


she left and I began playing


with the computer.


it did some wonderful


things


but then I noticed certain


inconsistencies.


the machine wouldn’t do


some of the things they claimed


it would.


my wife tried her hand at


it.


same thing.


so we shut the machine down


and went to


sleep.


the next day


when I came home from the


track


my wife told me that the


computer had a glitch or a


possible


virus.


my daughter had worked on it


all afternoon to


no avail.










43


so


for the time


being


my old IBM has


risen from the grave,


the bottle of beer


is to my left, and the little red


radio to my right is


playing


Bach.


my old


electric warrior


is back


typing this now


as the many parts of the


computer are


scattered across the


rug.


bravo!








































44
my god


you know that little girl


who used to play


on the lawn across the street?


look what happened


overnight:


new breasts


round ass


long legs


long hair


eyes of


blue fire.


we can no longer


think of her


as before.


now she is


15 years full of


trouble.




































45
after the sandstorm


coming off that park bench after the all-night sandstorm in El Paso


and walking into the library


I felt fairly comfortable even though I had less than two dollars


was alone in the world


and was 40 pounds underweight.


still it felt almost pleasant to


open that copy of the Kenyon Review in 1940


and marvel at the brilliant way those


professors used the language to take one another to task for the way each interpreted literature. I almost appreciated their humor and sarcasm,


but not quite: the professorial envy for one another was a bit too rancid and


red-steel-hot; but at the same time I envied the leisurely and safe lives that language and literature had evolved for them: places safe and soft and institutionalized.


I knew that I would never be able to write or live in quite that manner, yet I almost wanted to be one of them then,


at that moment.


I put the magazine back and walked outside, looked south north east west


each direction was wrong.


I started to walk along.


what I did sense was that language properly used


46


could be bright and beautiful but


I also sensed that there might be


some more important things I had


to learn


first.
























































































47
carry on!


the famous actor came by, I poured him a wine as he sat near the warm fireplace. he was really a nice fellow, had been in the business for decades, said that he really liked what I wrote. I told him, “thank you,” and poured him another wine.




then he began to describe his new tv series about a man and a woman


who adopted 3rd World children that nobody else wanted.


“I mean,” he said, “we’re going to try to capture the spirit of


loving family relationships and the goodness of it all.”


he was quite sincere, nothing phony about his desire.


“I realize,” I said, “that uplifting family programs are becoming very popular but . . .”


(I was thinking of the black actor, also with great talent,


who was on top of the ratings with his black family


but I often wondered what blacks in


the ghettos thought about the comfortable problems of those well-dressed, well-fed actors)






48


“. . . but there is another kind of family series I’d like to see that’s more real and more a part of our culture.”


he smiled. “what’s


that?”


“I’d like to see a series about a guy who works all day long in a factory, fighting to keep the job


he hates but is afraid of losing, while the foreman continually chews out his ass during the long hard hours. this guy finally punches out at the end of the day,


gets into his old car and is grateful when it starts just one more time.


then he drives back to his flat where the rent eats up one-half of his salary. he walks


in the door where his 3 kids in filthy clothes and dirty faces are bouncing a tennis


ball against the walls while his fat wife is passed out on the couch, snoring.


then he walks into the kitchen and the family dinner is burnt black on the stove with the gas still turned up high.”


“well,” said the actor, “what we are trying to do is uplift the spirit of the people, give


them hope and some sense of what a loving family is like.”


“yes,” I agreed, “that’s nice


too.”


we talked some more and I mentioned




49


some of the movies I had seen him in and enjoyed.


he kindly countered, singled out some of my writing that had pleased him.


then he had to leave, told me, “listen, we have to get together soon again!”


“anytime,” I


said.


he phoned a couple of days later early in the morning


and read me a poem about a fantasy baseball game: if you had 2 strikes against you: “CARRY ON!” and if you dropped an easy fly ball:


“CARRY ON!” and if you were one run behind in the 9th inning with 2 outs and you struck out with the bases loaded: “CARRY ON!” and etc.


and


it was a rhyming


poem.


“thank you very much,” I told


him.


“we’ve just got to get together again,” he said. “I love the way you talk!”


“sure,” I said, “anytime you get the chance. my time is anytime.”






50


I waited a few days, then phoned him twice.


once I got somebody who was


a secretary of some


sort.


the next time I got his


wife.


each time I left the message that


I was looking forward


to a visit from the famous


actor.


but now


weeks have gone by and still no


word.


well, a family tv series can be a


very demanding


experience.


people get busy, you know


that.


the other night I was sitting in front of the cable


flicking the remote control


and there came his face on the


screen


in some old


movie.


I watched: a tremendous talent, no doubt.


51


then I hit the remote control again and got the wrestling matches: Greenbutt Gus vs. The Swamp Man.


both also


tremendous


talents,


no doubt.














































































52
straw hats


I would never buy one, not at my


age, and I was never a


hat man anyhow


but then


that’s what wives are for:


to give you the incentive to


dive into uncharted


waters.


“go on, go on in,” said my


wife.


so I went into the shop and she


followed.


there were straw hats


everywhere, all colors and


sizes.


I tried on a black one, walked to


the mirror, looked like a killer


and, of course, liked that one best


but


returned the hat


anyhow.


“here,” said my wife,


“try this.”


I tried it on. not


bad. then


another one. not


bad.






53


I decided on those two.


holy hell!


I liked the clerks, they were


totally


uninterested.


“should I put them in a


bag?” one of the clerks


asked.


“a box,” I replied.


then


my wife came around the corner,


smiling, wearing a


straw hat


with a very wide brim.


she looked much better than


I.


she looked


cute.


beautiful.


“get it,” I


said.


“should I?”


“of course.”


so we walked out of there with


our new straw




54


hats


and we took them back


to the car


and put them


in their boxes


on the back


seat


and it was a good drive


home


under the low


clouds,


nothing wrong at


all.


very strange and


totally


acceptable.


and I never would have


worn the black one


anyhow.










































55
drink and wait


well, first Mae West died


and then George Raft,


and Eddie G. Robinson’s


been gone


a long time,


and Bogart and Gable


and Grable,


and Laurel and


Hardy


and the Marx Brothers,


all those Saturday


afternoons


at the movies


as a boy


are gone now


and I look


around this room


and it looks back at me


and out through


the window pane,


time hangs helpless


from the doorknob


as a gold


paperweight


of an owl


looks up at me


(an old man now)


who must endure


these many empty


Saturday


afternoons.










56
basking in the evil light


it all happened


many years ago


at Eveningtide Jr. High School.


I suppose it started in the boys’ shower after gym class when we decided that Harold Flemming had the


largest penis at


Eveningtide, only


in Harold’s case his penis was,


we decided,


almost beyond


human comprehension.


anyhow, he had a big


one and


the word got


out


and almost everybody knew about


it except


Miss Tully who taught


Biology.


the boys knew, the girls knew, the


gym teachers


knew


and


for some reason


it really bothered Masterson who


taught gym.


he was a little bully with a pot


belly who had the


hots for






57


Mrs. Gredis who taught


English.


well, there were 3 of us who


hung out


together:


me, Danny Hightower and Harold Flemming.


Masterson kept giving us


hard looks for no


reason.


one day he stopped us


outside the


cafeteria: “I’m going to


find out what you 3 are


up to even if I have to


follow you to the


ends of the


earth!”


we laughed at him because


we hadn’t done


anything wrong.


when we laughed he got


pissed and gave us


2 weeks on


lunch-garbage


detail.


on that detail we emptied


garbage cans




58


during lunchtime


and speared


pieces of paper with


nail-tipped sticks.


the girls watched us


and


giggled while


slyly glancing at Harold


Flemming.


they also


put their heads together and


whispered while they


giggled.


it felt great to get all


that


attention.


Danny Hightower loved


it too.


Flemming?


well, he never said


much.


then it happened over-


night: one day I came to


school and both Danny Hightower and


Flemming were


missing.


I soon got the


word: Harold


Flemming had




59


had intercourse with some


girl


behind the


chemistry building and


had


almost


torn her


apart.


and somehow Danny


Hightower was


involved.


but what he had


to do with it


wasn’t entirely


clear.


then


a couple of


weeks later


further word


came down: Harold


Flemming and Danny


Hightower were at


Gateford Hills, the Boys


Reformatory.


it was soon after


that when


Masterson


stopped me outside the


cafeteria.






60


he looked very


intense.


he looked like he was


ready to


swing at me.


I hoped he


would.


I felt I could take


him.


“all right,” he said,


“I know you were there!


I’m going to


get you


too!”


“yeah?” I


asked.


“you think I


won’t?”


* didn’t


answer.


“stop sneering!” he


yelled.


* hadn’t realized that I was.




61


“2 weeks garbage!” he


yelled.


I shrugged and walked


off


pretending to be


very tough and


evil


pretending I was


just one more


great secret fucker of


jr. high school


girls


but I knew


without Harold Flemming


at my side


that I was


nothing


and worse


the girls knew it


too.






























62
what can I do?


it’s true:


pain and suffering


helps to create


what we call


art.


given the choice


I’d never choose


this damned


pain


and suffering


for myself


but somehow it finds


me


as the royalties


continue to


roll on


in.














































63
out of the sickroom and into the white blazing sun


hey, you’re not dead, you’re


doing good, damned good again,


what’s this talk about tossing it


in?


what you were doing while you


were feeling sick enough


to die,


what you were really doing was just re-


charging your


batteries.


now let everybody get


out of the way,


you’re thundering


down the track again


like a locomotive


hauling 90 thousand


unwritten poems


and they’re all


yours


and you’re pounding along


the rails


sometimes through dark tunnels


but then roaring out again


into the


light!


who the hell said that


you no longer had it in


you?






64


it was you who said that.


the engineer


who is now


feeling a fresh surge of


hope and


power


and who is


grinning madly at the


thought of this


wonderful


new


day.




























































65
temporal ease


you can’t know how good it feels driving in for a wash-and-wax with nothing to do but light a cigarette and


wait in the sun with no overdue rent, no troubles to speak of as you hide from the whores.


now here it comes, clean, glistening black, you tip the man $2, get in, run up the aerial, adjust the side mirror,


start the engine, turn on the radio classical, move out into the street.


open the sun roof, take the slow lane, hangover gone, you’re sleepy in the sun . . . and then you’re there.


the parking lot attendants know you: “hey, Champ, how’s it going?”


inside, you open the Racing Form, decide to spend the day with the runners . . . already you’ve spotted two low-price sucker bets in the first race that will not win—that’s all you need, an edge.


“Hank . . .”


it’s somebody behind you, you turn, it’s your old post office buddy, Spencer Bishop.


“hey, Spence . . .”


“hey, man, I hear you been fooling the people, I hear you been going around to the universities and giving lectures . . .”


“that’s right, my man.”




66


“what are you going to do when they find you out?”


“I’ll come back and join you.”


you go to your seat and watch them come out for the post parade


(you could be painting or in the botanical gardens)


but the 6 looks good in the Form and in the flesh.


7⁄2 is not the world but it’s over a third.


you get up and move to the windows.


the screenplay is finished, you’re into the 4th


novel, the poems keep arriving, not much going on with the short story but that’s waiting, fixing itself up, that whore is getting ready.


“ten-win-six,” you say to the teller.


it’s the beginning of a most pleasant afternoon.


my next university lecture will be THE POSITIVE INFLUENCE OF GAMBLING AS A MEANS OF


DEFINING EXPERIENCE AS SOMETHING THAT CAN BE TOUCHED LIKE


A BOOK OF MATCHES OR


A SOUP SPOON.


yes, you think, going back to sit down, it’s true.






67
you never liked me


I let Reena give you a blow job


even though she was my wife,


I used to drive you to all your


poetry readings


and I have some photographs


of you in compromising


positions


with that hooker


but I’ve never shown them to


anyone.


Reena and I shared that motel


room with you down at Hermosa


Beach where you


tried to rape Robert’s


widow


and I guess you don’t


remember demanding that


the manager turn on the


swimming pool lights at


3:30 a.m.?


you tried to


drown him


afterwards


and I was the guy


who stopped him from


calling the cops.


and the time you wanted to


suicide


I was the one who gave you


those uppers.


you insulted my father and




68


his wife


and I was the one who talked


him out of killing


you; he was packing a


.45...


and I drove you all over the


streets of Hollywood


for hours that day


until you found


your


car.


I’m sure


I’ve done many things for


you


that you don’t even


remember,


still, you never


particularly


liked


me.


yet, I never asked


anything from you


before


but now there’s


something


I need.


I’ve written


a frank memoir


about you


and our wild times together




69


and I want you


to give my publisher


your blessing.


o.k.?


by the way, I’ve been


following your


career.


I read your last


book.


it was


all right.


Reena sends her


love.


lemme know about


the blessing.


and don’t you worry about


those


photographs.


your pal,


Benny.

our big day at the movies


it was during the Depression and the Saturday matinee was for children and we stood in long lines a good hour before the theater even opened.


there was always a double feature but one was an adult movie which they featured first before we got to see our Buck Rogers space movie.


the movie houses in those days were imposing and clean with high curved ceilings and fancy columns and the seats were big


and soft and the rugs in the aisles were red and thick and there was always an usher or usherette with a flashlight as we sat with jawbreaker candy in our mouths and waited.


the adult movie was usually pure agony and at the time there was an endless series of films


featuring Fred and Ginger, we saw movie after dreadful movie of them dancing for hours, it was really terrible, headache bad.


he wore shiny black shoes and a fancy coat with long tails, the coattails flying as he pranced and tap-danced.


he would leap on tables or dance along the rail of a balcony far above the street below and he had this little fixed smile on his face, and she danced too, the blonde with curly hair, she followed him in lockstep and now and then he would toss her in the


air while she maintained a pleased and adoring expression on her face.


71


there was always a minor plot in the movie, little bits of trouble would arrive and to cure every-
thing he would begin dancing with her, that was the answer, the solution. sometimes they even kissed and we would all look away and groan in disgust.


he was somebody to despise with his sunken little face and thinning


hair and weak chin and sharp nose, always just dancing, dancing, dancing like someone gone mad.


I had never seen any man like that living in our neighborhood;


our fathers would have run him off! the lady wasn’t so bad, she was kind of pretty but stupid to fall for a fellow like that.
sometimes those movies got so bad that just for relief a couple of the boys would get into a fight but the ushers always quickly stopped it.


yes, it was agony watching those dancers especially when they kissed


but it would finally end and then there was a cartoon, Popeye, he’d eat a


can of spinach and punch out some big ugly guy.


the ugly guy looked more like our fathers than that dancing freak did.








72


our movie would come on then and we’d really start to live! space machines, space wars, the evil Villain of Space and also his evil Sidekick and Buck Rogers would be captured and chained in a dungeon somewhere


but somehow he always finally got away.


some of the space guns were


terrific, they’d shoot rays


and people would just vanish


in a flash


and the beautiful rocket ships would shoot through space and there were tremendous battles between


Buck Rogers and the Villain space ships (they were terrible like hungry sharks and evil looking). there was tension, fierce tension, and then some new and horrible development would suddenly take place which Buck Rogers would some-how overcome.


Buck always survived.


although he really had us worried


at times—like when he was


chained to this metal table with a


giant circular saw creeping closer


and closer.


there were many such narrow


escapes.






73


and then it would all be over


and we’d have to go back to our own lives,


to our parents, to whatever Depression dinner they had managed to prepare.


but during those Saturday evenings after the movies


we all felt different somehow,


strange, a little unreal, watching


our parents eat and converse,


our parents,


those people that had never experienced anything exciting or real, who seemed hardly alive,


they were almost as boring as


that kissing dancer with his flying


coattails


but not quite,


nothing could ever be


as bad as


that.










































74
about competition


the higher you climb


the greater the pressure.


those who manage to


endure


learn


that the distance


between the


top and the


bottom


is


obscenely


great.


and those who


succeed


know


this secret:


there isn’t


one.










































75
fingernails


the nurse looked at


my face.


“are you a factory worker?”


she asked.


“no,” I said.


“then this didn’t


happen on the job?”


“no,” I said, “I don’t


work.”


“how did this happen?”


the nurse asked.


“a woman,” I explained,


“fingernails.”


“oh,” she laughed,


“well, fill out this


questionnaire. the doctor will


see you in a minute.”


there was a long list of


strange questions:


have you ever been in a


mental institution?


have you had v.d.?


are your parents


alive?


do you resist


authority?


do you sleep on your


back?


are you sexually active?


what is your favorite


color?






76


if you had a chance,


would you take


it?


I felt that the nurse


had possibly given me


the wrong questionnaire.


there were a dozen more


questions of a


similar nature.


to all the questions


* answered,


* don’t know.


the doctor came in,


glanced at the sheet,


put it down.


“you say a woman did


this?”


“yes.”


“did she also bite you?”


“yes.”


“what do you want?”


“a tetanus shot.”






77


“when did you have your last


one?”


“I don’t know.”


the doctor grabbed my


face, started


picking at it.


some of the scab


came loose.


* began bleeding.


“how does that feel?”


he asked.


“just fine,” I told


him.


“o.k.,” he said, “the


nurse will give you a


shot.”


he began to walk out of


the room


then stopped and


turned. “by the way,


why did the woman


do this to you?”


“I wish I knew,” I said.


“I really wish I knew.”




78


the doctor left.


as the blood began to


trickle down and soak into


the collar of my


shirt I closed my


eyes and waited.

iron


we all go through it, those times


when we decide to angrily challenge everyone and everything.


first we decide to get in shape.


we start pumping iron again,


slack muscles reluctantly responding.


then we go back to


hanging around the toughest


joints,


sitting quietly, waiting for


trouble, daring


trouble to show its face


and it finally arrives in the


form of some greasy


lowdown


hammerfisted


drunk.


* misunderstanding ensues
and outside we go, fist against bone, sucking it up,
throwing punches straight from the shoulder,
grunting, sucking air, shaking off the shots, planting our feet,


the drunken screaming crowd panting for somebody’s anybody’s
demise.






80


you test the hammerfists


one by one


find some of them


wanting but,


fortunately, not


all.


the low-life ladies love


men who


fight.


and into your dim


room


they will now glide,


excited by your


dumb


valor


but soon


they will begin


to suck at your


independence;


with patience,


with guile,


they will try to claim you


permanently as their very own


making those


hammerfisted drunks


by comparison


look


harmless and


pale.


then you are sitting


around one night




81


in your cheap hotel


room


with


whoever


and she’s speaking of her


unhappy childhood or about


the time she


hitchhiked alone through


the


untamed Amazon


and it hits you like a


kick in the gut:


what am I doing to myself


and why?


and you stop pumping


iron and


you dump her or better


yet, let her dump


you.


then you dump your misguided plan.


you abandon the proving


ground;


the proving ground


proves nothing


of importance.


it’s all just


vanity stuffing its


own swollen


self.




82


you back away,


regroup.


it’s easy.


a month later in some


public place


a boor and a bull


gives you the


elbow, a bit of a


shove.


he’s in a hurry about


something and


you’re slightly in his


way.


you catch his


eye.


“sorry, man,” you


say, “you o.k.?”


he’s puzzled, can’t


make that out at


all.


fine.


a man has to circle,


finally come back to where


he was.


sometimes it takes a


while.


other times, perhaps, it can’t




83


be done.


but since I have


finally accomplished this,


become reasonable and sane again, the women have become more beautiful and the


rooms larger and lighter,


not that I have searched for


either


but they have finally


found me.


of course, I still pump


iron at odd and


infrequent


moments;


old habits often die


as slowly


as do


old men.

extraterrestrial visitor


it was a hot afternoon in July.


her daughter was at the swimming


pool.


her son was at the roller rink.


we talked a while and then


gradually got down to it.


I was just


sliding in


when I thought I heard a


sound.


I pulled out and looked


around.


standing by the bed was this


black kid


about five years old.


he was barefoot.


“what do you want?” I


asked him.


“you got any empty bottles?”


he asked.


“no, I don’t have any


empty bottles.”


he left, disappointed.


“I thought the door was locked,”


she said, “that was Clovis’s


little boy.”


“Clovis’s little boy?”


“yes.”


I suppose it was.










85
small talk


I left the barstool to go


to the men’s room.


I found that


there wasn’t a urinal in


the men’s room


just a toilet without a


lid


and in the toilet were


some ugly turds.


I kicked the flush-lever


with my foot but the


lever was broken.


I urinated while looking


away,


zipped up,


went to the sink: no


soap in the dispenser.


I turned the water


faucet on


and there was only


a trickle of


cold rusty liquid.


there were no paper


towels


and a large piece of glass


was missing


at the corner


of the mirror.


I left the men’s room and


walked back to my stool,


sat down.






86


“you think Valenzuela’s


going to sign with the


Dodgers?” the barkeep


asked me.


“doesn’t matter to me,”


I said, “I don’t like


baseball.”


“you don’t like baseball?”


he asked. “are you some kind of


queer?”


“not that I know of,” I


told him. “give me another


beer.”


as he bent over the cooler


I was privileged to view his


vast gross buttocks.


near the crotch of his


white pants was a large yellow


stain.


he came up with the bottle


flipped the lid off and


banged the beer down


in front of me.


“if you don’t like baseball


what the hell do you


do in your spare time?”


he asked me.




87


“fuck,” I said.


“dreamer,” he answered


picking up my change and


walking to the cash


register.


“that too,” I said.


I don’t think he


heard me.

too sweet


I have been going to the track for so long that


all the employees know


me,


and now with winter here


it’s dark before the last


race.


as I walk to the parking lot


the valet recognizes my


slouching gait


and before I reach him


my car is waiting for me,


lights on, engine warm.


the other patrons


(still waiting)


ask,


“who the hell is that


guy?”


I slip the valet a


tip, the size depending upon the


luck of the


day (and my luck has been amazingly good lately)


and I then am in the machine and out on the street


as the horses break


from the gate.


I drive east down Century Blvd.


turning on the radio to get the result of that last race.






89


at first the announcer is concerned only with bad weather and poor freeway conditions.


we are old friends: I have listened to his voice for decades but,


of course, the time will finally come when neither one of us will need to clip our toenails or


heed the complaints of our


women any longer.


meanwhile, there is a certain rhythm to the essentials that now need attending to.


I light my cigarette


check the dashboard


adjust the seat and


weave between a Volks and a Fiat.


as flecks of rain spatter the


windshield


I decide not to die just


yet:


this good life just smells too


sweet.

work-fuck problems


I’m in Arizona


on a drive back from a horse stable


to the cabin where we’re staying


air cooler blowing


boy and dog on floor laughing.


my dirty room back home is beyond the desert many miles and a lifetime away as I sit here inside my self


creating half-felt emotions.


the way to create art is to burn and destroy ordinary concepts and to substitute them


with new truths that run down from the top of the head and out from the heart.


this boy isn’t mine this dog isn’t mine the cabin


where I’m staying


isn’t mine


but I own one-half of this typewriter.


after the drive back from the horse stable I find the lady has gone to do her laundry leaving me to burn and destroy


ordinary concepts.


well, I could be working in a factory instead or driving a taxi


or picking tomatoes


if they’d hire me.


the boy walks in with a water gun,


squirts me.




91


“look, kid,” I say, “I am trying to make a living. I’m not good for anything else, even picking tomatoes . . .”


the lady and I often argue about our WORK.


how are we going to get any WORK done


if we lie around and fuck day and night?


old Ez used to say DO YOUR WORK but he fucked too.


me, I figure I can always WORK


but I can’t always FUCK so I concentrate on FUCK and let the WORK come when it can.


confidence, I have that, and a bit of talent.


but the lady is worried. she thinks I am going to fuck us into the poorhouse.


creation is like anything else good:


you have to wait on it; ambition has killed more artists than indolence.


I am not infected with ambition


I am quite content;


sitting across from the horse barn at 3 p.m. in the afternoon


I wait for Art to create me.


it’s really pleasant


after 100 bad jobs


15 bad woman


and almost 60 bad years.




92


I listen to an opera on the radio


while outside the Indians and Mexicans bend in the hot sun dreaming of wine bottles and revolution.


I too have been on their cross


now all I need to do is record the screams in my


memory


well enough


and wait for the lady to come back with her laundry.

observations on music


I have sat for thousands of nights listening to symphony music on the radio; I doubt that there are many men my age who have listened to as much classical music as I have—


even those in the profession.


I am not a musicologist


but


I have some observations:


1. the same 50 or 60 classical compositions are played over and over
and over again.


2. there has been other great music written that we ignore at our peril.
3. the second movement of most symphonies is only kind to insomniacs.
4. chamber music has every right to be energetic and entertaining.
5. very few composers know how to END their symphonies
but


most opening movements, like romance, have early charm.
6. I prefer a conductor who inserts his own interpretation rather than the purist who blindly follows the commands of the master.
7. of course, there are always some conductors with so much ego and “interpretation” that the composer
vanishes.


8. music is much like fucking, but some composers can’t










94


climax and others climax too often, leaving themselves and the listener
jaded and spent.


9. humor is lacking in most so-called great musical compositions.
10. Bach is the hardest to play badly because he made so few spiritual mistakes.
11. almost all symphonies and operas could be shorter.
12. too much contemporary music is written from the safe haven of a university. a composer must still
experience life in its raw form in order to write well.
13. music is the most passionate of the art forms;


I wish I had been a musician or a composer.


14. very few writers know how to END a poem like this one
15. but I do.

fly boy


I was 8 years old and it wasn’t going well.


my father was a brute and my mother was his assistant.


the boys in the neighborhood


disliked me.


I had a hiding place.


it was on the garage roof.


it was very hot up there


and I stripped down and sunbathed. I decided to become bronzed and strong.


I did push-ups and sweated in the


sun.


the roof was covered with white


pebbles which bit into my


skin,


but I never became bronzed, I only burned to an idiot red.


but I continued up there on the roof.


it was my hiding place.


then I got it into my head that I could fly.


I don’t know how it started, it was


gradual, the idea that I could


fly.


but as time went on the idea


became stronger and


stronger.


I wasn’t sure why I wanted to


fly






96


but the idea of it possessed me


more and more.


I found myself perched on the


edge of the roof


several times


but I always stepped back.


then the afternoon came when I


decided that I would fly.


suddenly, I felt sure that I could.


I was elated.


I stepped to the edge of the roof,


leaped out and flapped


my arms.


I plunged down and hit


the ground, hard.


when I got up I found there


was something wrong with


my right ankle.


I could barely walk.


I limped into the house, made


it to the bedroom and got on


my bed.


an hour later my ankle was


swollen,


huge.


I took off my shoe.


my parents arrived home at


about this time.


“Henry, where are you?”


asked my father.










97


“I’m in here.”


they both entered, my


father first and my mother


behind him.


“what happened to your


ankle, Henry?” my mother asked.


“an accident.”


“an accident?” my father asked.


“what kind of accident?”


“I tried to fly, it didn’t work.”


“fly? how? from where?”


“from the roof of the garage.”


“so, that’s where you’ve been


hiding lately?”


“yes.”


“do you realize this means a


doctor bill?


do you realize we don’t have


any money?”


“I don’t need a doctor.”










98


“doctors cost money!


get in the bathroom!”


I got up and hobbled into the


bathroom.


“take down your pants!


your shorts!”


I did.


“doctors cost money!”


he reached for his razor


strop.


I felt the first bite of


it.


a flash of light


exploded in my


head.


he came down with the


strop again.


the sound of it against my


flesh was


horrible.


“fucking doctors!”


the strop landed


again


and then I knew why I had


wanted to






99


fly . . . to fly


right through the walls,


to fly


right out the


window,


to any place but


here.

unblinking grief


the last cigarettes are smoked, the loaves are sliced, and lest this be taken for wry sorrow, drown the spider in wine.


you are much more than simply dead:


I am a dish for your ashes,


I am a fist for your vanished air.


the most terrible thing about life


is finding it gone.








































































101
houses and dark streets


one of my greatest weaknesses is getting lost. I am always getting lost, I have dreams about getting lost, and this is why I fear going to foreign countries: the possibility


of getting lost and not knowing the language.


I was once lost in the Utah wilderness for


nine hours but I also get lost on streets and freeways.


you’ll see me pull into a gas station and ask:


“give me a couple of gallons of gas and can you tell me where I am?”


I’ll find the right freeway but then drive in the wrong direction, drive fearfully


for many miles along with hundreds of people who know exactly where they are going. I’ll then
try going in the opposite direction, give up, get off the freeway and


get lost again on a dark road with no streetlights and silent, darkened houses:


many dark houses and a dark street and no help in sight.


I’ll turn on the car radio and sit and


listen to the friendly voices and the smooth music—but that only increases my madness and fear.


there hasn’t been a woman I have lived with who hasn’t received this phone call:


“listen, baby, I’m lost, I’m in a phone booth and I don’t know where I am!” “go outside,” they say, “and look for a street sign.”


I come back after a few minutes with the information and






102


they calmly tell me what to do.


I don’t understand the instructions.


then there’s much screaming back and forth.


“it’s simple!” they scream.


“I CAN’T DO IT!” I scream back.


once after driving around for hours I stopped and rented a motel room. luckily there was a liquor store across the street.


I got two fifths of vodka and sat up watching tv


pretending that life was good and that I was perfectly normal and in control of the situation. I was finally able to sleep shortly after opening the second bottle of vodka.


in the morning when I went to turn in my key I asked the lady, “by the way, could you tell me which way I go to get to L.A.?”


“you’re in L.A.,” she told me.


once leaving the Santa Anita racetrack one evening


I swung off onto a side road to avoid the


traffic and the side road started to curve sharply and I worried about that so I cut off onto another side road and I don’t know when it happened but the paved street vanished and I was driving along on a


small dusty road and then the road started climbing as the evening darkened into night and






103


I kept driving, feeling completely idiotic and vanquished.


I tried to turn off the steep road but each


turn led me to a narrower road climbing even higher, and I thought, if I ever see my woman again I’m going to tell her that I’m a true subnormal,


that I must be restricted or kept in bed or that I should be confined to an institution.


the road climbed higher and higher into the hills and then I was on top of wherever it was and there was a lovely little village brightly lit with neon signs and the language on all the signs was Chinese! and then I knew that I was both lost and insane!


I had no idea what it all meant, so I just kept driving and then looking down I saw the Pasadena freeway a thousand feet below: all I had to do was find a way to get down there.


and that was another nightmare trying to


work my way down those steep streets lined with expensive dark houses.


the poor will never know how many rich Chinese hide out quietly in those hills.


I finally reached the freeway after another 45 minutes and, of course, I got on in the wrong direction.


I don’t like psychiatrists but I’ve often thought about asking one of them about all this. but maybe I already have the answer.


all the women I’ve lived with have told me the same thing:


“you’re just a fool,” they say.




104
the joke is on the sun


as the game continues you


should seek to say ever more clearly


what you truly


believe


even if what you truly


believe


turns out to be


wrong.


it can be a hazardous


and difficult


task.


but


if you can’t laugh


at the impossible odds


we all endure as


we seek to understand


and know


then you will


surely sleep


restless


in the


coffin.

part 2








if I bet on Humanity


I’d never cash a ticket.


like a polluted river flowing


the freeways are a psychological


entanglement of


warped souls,


dying flowers in the dying hour


of the dying day.


old cars, young drivers,


new models driven by


aged men, driven by


drivers without licenses, by drunk


drivers, by drugged drivers,


by suicidal drivers, by super-cautious drivers (the worst).


drivers with minds like camels,


drivers who piss in their seats,


drivers who yearn to kill,


drivers who love to gamble,


drivers who blame everybody else,


drivers who hate everybody,


drivers who carry guns.


drivers who don’t know what


rearview


mirrors are for,


what the turn signals are for,


drivers who drive without brakes,


drivers who drive on bald tires.


drivers who drive slowly in the fast lane, drivers who hate their wives or their husbands, and want to make you pay for that. unemployed drivers, pissed.


109


all these represent


humanity in general, totally enraged, demented, vengeful, spiteful, cheap denizens of our culture, vultures, jackals, sharks, suckerfish, stingrays, lice . . .


all on the freeway along with you


tailgating,


cutting in and out,


cheating themselves,


leering,


their radios blaring the worst music ever written, their gas tanks nearly empty, engines overheating,


minds over the next hill,


they don’t know how to drive


or live,


they know less than a snail crawling home.


they are what you see every day


going from nowhere to nowhere,


they elect presidents, procreate, decorate their Christmas trees.


what you see on the freeway is just what there is, a funeral procession of the dead,


the greatest horror of our time in motion.


I’ll see you there tomorrow!

girlfriends


the women of the past keep


phoning.


there was another yesterday


arrived from out of


state.


she wanted to see


me.


I told her


“no.”


I don’t want to see


them,


I won’t see them.


it would be


awkward


gruesome and


useless.


I know some people who can


watch the same movie


more than


once.


not me.


once I know the


plot


once I know the


ending


whether it’s happy or


unhappy or


just plain


dumb,


then

for me


that movie is


finished


forever


and that’s why

escape 1942


in San Francisco I watched them


march into the


shipyards


with their hard hats,


carrying their


lunch pails.


my father had written me


from Los Angeles: “If you


don’t want to go to War


then work in the


shipyards, help your country


and


make some money.”


I was insane.


I just sat in a small room and


stared at the walls.


now, many of those


shipyard workers


have found that


they were exposed to


asbestos


poisoning, and some of them


are now doomed to a slow


incurable


death.


one thing I found out


early


about my father’s advice:


ignore it




113


without remorse


and you would avoid


many of life’s


ordinary


agonies.


there would always


be


enough


of the other


kind.

a strange horse poem


yes, I once rode this strange horse everywhere from 1940 until 1950


and his name was Nothing and we rode through New Orleans, St. Louis, N.Y.C., east Kansas City, you name it, you name


the city—Atlanta, that was a real son of a bitch—and sometimes the horse was named Greyhound, sometimes it was named Greynothing, lots of young girls there, usually sitting with


somebody


else, somebody dressed in a soldier’s uniform looking damned dumb to me but damned good to everybody else. I could never get fucked, not that I wanted to, that was too


impossible,


too far away, I just wanted to be included, to sit in a room somewhere with them,


watch the way their dresses moved as they crossed their legs, but I always ended up with just a job and not a woman, a tiny job somewhere in a ladies’ dress shop or pushing dress samples or bolts


of cloth


in a wooden cart through the streets of some city which name


I have now forgotten—up long ramps into tiny dark elevators with the cart


and the samples and the bolts of cloth, and once in the elevator you tugged on


a rope threaded through wooden spools, you yanked on the rope to stop and


start the thing, and there was hardly any light, you really had to look


hard to see the numbers of the floors written on the wall in faded white chalk: 3, 6, 9, 10 . . . yank, stop . . . and push out to be greeted by easily panicked old ladies and (forgive me) a fat comfortable Jew with bright suspenders and an almost-paternal glow, he looked better and kinder than any of us.






115


yes, I once rode this strange horse everywhere,


getting stuck briefly now and then in an all-yellow jail cell; the yellow paint flecking off the bars showing gray paint underneath,
always


a lidless toilet and a metal sink but the sink never worked,


it just dripped water out of a rusty faucet and you ducked your head in there and sucked at the drops when you were thirsty.


I once stood in a Coca-Cola plant in Atlanta, damn it, not wanting to be there, not wanting to be there at all, this man telling me, “I’m
sorry, all


we have is one opening, $60 a month, we’d like to


offer you more but there’s a government freeze on wages.”


yes, I rode this strange horse everywhere and I want you to know that for the insane and for other certain types


of people there are never any jobs anywhere and that even in good times, in time of war, that there is a line


19 deep for the shittiest jobs in existence, and that the hardest job to find is as a dishwasher or a busboy or as a messenger boy for Western Union.


I rode this strange horse, I was this horse, so I want it known. much later I was to meet women who would tell me, “Jesus,
Chinaski,


why did you take all those terrible jobs when you easily could have . . .”


I hate those women, hate those women who say


that, sitting in their plush offices, perhaps at some record company, sniffing at drugs, purses full of pills, and them acting


ultra superior, taking me back to their apartments to fuck, and






116


expecting me to love and admire them when they had ridden their horse exactly nowhere.


a cheap hotel in New Orleans: getting up at 6 a.m.


to go to work after a


night of 3 bottles of cheap wine, going out in the


dark, cold hall, leaving your room to look for a place to shit and shave, but each little toilet taken, someone in there shaving, and while you were


waiting, seeing rats as large as your hand scurrying


back and forth just before sunrise, running up and down along the rusty corridor, you knew then that your father was right, you’d always be a bum, you had no drive, and suddenly the horse was very tired so you went back to bed, $4


left in your wallet, enough for some wine later and some change left over.


I rode this strange horse and I rode this horse and I knew that for some there would never be good times no matter how good the times were, I knew that for some there


would never be something as simple as a woman, and for some never a


decent life, and finally dying like that, and maybe the better for it?


you don’t know how faithfully I rode this horse, you don’t know how I clashed with men who would fight to the end over a piece of garbage, you don’t know the terrible nights,


the night jobs of working with creatures with faces as blank as paper bags and you trying


to find something, anything, behind that paper bag.










117


“Jesus, Chinaski, why didn’t you find a job as a writer or somethin’?” the ladies asked much later.


I checked out another job, shipping clerk, just a block from my little room in Philadelphia, next to my favorite bar; I


got up early, took a bath, walked in and there were 8 others waiting ahead of me


INCLUDING


one returning W.W.II vet in full uniform with all his medals on.


well, they hired me because I lived just a block away and they thought I’d never be late for work (but I was always late for work).


this strange horse, you know, I’ve ridden him everywhere, I was riding him just now when I accidentally smashed the glass out of the bathroom window, my blood flung all up and down the stairway as I chased him through the dark garden, throwing rocks, blank naked under the blank moon, ripping plants up


by their roots, this strange horse, you know, he won’t behave. and I remember another time blandishing about with some dopesters, “we’ll cut you in, baby, you’re the toughest guy we know. we want you in.”


but somehow that wasn’t what I wanted either. “listen,” I told them, “I am really honored but I’m just not interested in that sort of thing.”


then I got on my strange horse and rode off, searching as ever for the grapefruit dream.












118
the longest snake in the world


I parked outside, nice and shady, walked in.


I had a 2 p.m. appointment.


they took me right away, no waiting.


led me to a special room.


the doctor had a little smile.


the nurse looked bored.


“please take off your clothes,” she said.


I stripped.


“have you ever had one of these examinations before?” the Dr.


asked.


“no.”


“well, you’re in for a treat.”


“assume the position,” said the nurse, “on the chair.”


there was a specially made


chair.


I climbed onto it.


they strapped my wrists down.


my ass was up in the air.


“it isn’t going to hurt,” said the


doc. “we’re just going to take a look around inside of you, there’s a light on the
end of this coil and it lets us see inside, it even allows us to take photos, we slide this tube right up into your intestine.”


119


is it too late to change my mind? I asked myself.


my mother-in-law had told my wife that she had been through the same procedure and that


there was nothing to it, nothing to worry about.


she was always so helpful.


“now we’re going to slide this up into your intestine, you’ll feel a little something but don’t worry . . .”


“right now?”


“right now. we’re going in slowly . . . slowly . . .”


“you can breathe,” said the nurse.


“thank you.”


“this will be over so quickly you won’t even


know we’ve done it,”


said the doc.


“but you’ll bill me anyway . . .”


“the office will bill you. now, a little further . . .”


I imagined my white-haired mother-in-law crouched in the same position, trying to act brave and dignified.








120


a good girl, a good old girl.


nobody like her.


“umm hmmm,” I heard the


doctor say.


“keep breathing,” said the nurse.


“now we’re coming out,” said the doctor.


“coming out now, slowly . . .”


I had noticed the long tube coiled around the


large spool. there was a lot of intestine to examine in the


average human


being.


“we’re finished,” said the doctor.


“are you relieved?”


“oh, yeah!”


the nurse handed me a handful of


tissue.


“please clean yourself and get dressed.”


I did that.


then I sat there waiting, staring at the thick black tube coiled on the big spool.


after a while the doctor walked back






121


in.


he was holding a piece of


paper.


“is ‘Chinaski’ Polish?” he


asked.


“it might be but I was born in


Germany.”


“you now live in Palos Verdes?”


“San Pedro.”


“San Pedro?


do you like it there?”


“doctor, for Christ’s sake! do I have cancer or not?”


“no, but you do have internal


hemorrhoids.”


“that’s fine with me.”


“you should have them taken care


of.


we use rubber bands.”


“rubber bands?”


“yes, we tie them in there and when the bands dissolve the hemorrhoids are gone.”






122


“I don’t think I’ll bother.”


driving back home


my ass didn’t hurt at


all.


I punched on the radio, punched


in the lighter.


the lighter jumped out and I put it to my cigarette.


there was a red light ahead.


I stopped.


there were 4 cars ahead of me


and a couple


behind.


and thankfully none of them knew a damned thing about what had happened to me and they never


would.
















































123
the niceties


I took my wife and mother-in-law to dinner.


everything was all right until my mother-


in-law asked for


dessert.


I called the waiter over and


he brought her the dessert.


for the moment everything was


fine


but as he stood there


my mother-in-law looked up at


him


and mentioned that there was a


different name for that same


dessert


back east;


they called it something different


in Pennsylvania.


“oh,” said the waiter, “are you


from Pennsylvania?”


that made my mother-in-law smile.


“yes,” she said, “are you?”


the waiter said “no,” that


he was from


Michigan.


my wife then said something about Kalamazoo.


the waiter replied that he had a


sister in Kalamazoo.


“oh, do you go back there for


the holidays?” my mother-in-law


asked.


the waiter said, “no,” he had




124


gone to Las Vegas instead.


then my wife asked him if he had won any money in Las Vegas.


and the waiter said, “well,


actually, I did.”


“oh, that’s fine!” said my


mother-in-law.


then


somehow


the conversation got turned


back to Michigan, to one of the other cities in Michigan and


the waiter said he had gone to


college there.


“oh,” said my mother-in-law,


“one of my brothers went to that same school!” “oh really?” said the waiter. “he studied medicine there!”


said my mother-in-law.


about that time I decided to


tune out.


I could hear the sounds


but I allowed the content


to drift over my head.


it was very peaceful.


“HE’S ASKING YOU SOMETHING!” I heard my wife say.


I looked up.


the waiter was asking, “can I fill




125


your water glass?”


“no, thanks,” I replied.


the waiter walked off and my


mother-in-law


dug her spoon into the


dessert,


lifted a little round


bite


and slid it into her


mouth.


she liked sweets and she was


from Pennsylvania.

time to water the plants and feed the cat


that woman took longer to dress than any woman I had ever known.


one night first we made love, then looked at tv, then we slept.


in the morning she was up, getting ready to go to work.


I watched her through narrowed eyes; I checked her buttocks and legs.


I got tired of that, it was about 7:30 a.m.


and I went back to sleep.


I awakened at 8:00, walked to the bathroom,


pulled open the door.


I screamed.


she was standing there naked in front of the mirror. “Jesus Christ,” I said, “I thought you had gone to work!”


“do you want to use the bathroom?” she asked.


“no, it’s all right.”


I went back to bed. soon she came in and kissed me goodbye with those big red lips and I smelled her good perfume.


“phone me at work,” she said, “it always cheers me up.”


after she left I went in and had a


shower. I found a Fresca in the refrigerator drank that and went back to sleep.


I had a real hot dream: two women were fighting each other.


each wanted to give it all to me.


at first one would win for a while and


then the other would pull her off and have her turn until the first one pulled her off and etc. . . . I awakened. I was steaming.


127


then I got up and took a cold bath, got dressed, then phoned her at work: “I gotta go home now,” I told her.


“oh,” she said, “just stay one more night.” “no,” I answered, “I can’t . . .” “why?” she asked.


“I’ve got to go home, water the plants, feed the cat,” I explained.


“do that and come back. we’ll have dinner out. I know a great place,” she said, “and it’s on me.”


“I’ve got to go home,” I said, “I’ve got to rest.” “but,” she said, “you rest all the time, you’re always in bed . . .”


“how about this weekend?” I asked. “suppose I see you this weekend? it’s already Thursday.”


“well, all right, bad boy,” she answered, “this weekend then . . .”


I got into my Volks and drove away from there.


a man in his late fifties has to


pace himself and


some women expect love to be


inexhaustible.






























128
I’m flattered


the phone rang at 7 a.m.; I was in the kitchen;


I picked up the phone. “Hank?” “yes.”


“how are you doing?” “fine. I was just feeding


the cats.” “I’m calling you because


someone just phoned me and said, ‘Hank died last night,’ then they hung up.” “I’m all right, I’m feeding the cats.” “when I heard that I almost cried, I was so shocked.” “I’m flattered.” “I’m calling from


New York,” she said, “but when I get back I’d like to come see you, I’ll bring my new boyfriend.” “sure, be glad to see you.”


that was the end of the conversation. I hung up.


all 5 cats were now looking at me, ten eyes.


there was a sixth cat upstairs. she ate upstairs because the other cats terrorized her.


I spooned the cat food into the 5 dishes and placed them on the floor. they went for it.


every 2 or 3 years somebody tells somebody else that I have died and I then must tell that somebody else: no, no, I’m just fine.


that’s as bad as some woman named Helen who


told everybody that she had been married to me for several years and hated every minute of it.


and what about the time somebody who called himself Hank Chinaski went






129


up and down the aisles at a poetry reading shaking people’s hands?


I take the sixth bowl of food upstairs to the cat the other cats terrorize and I set it down and she goes for it.


then I go back to bed with my real wife who is still asleep and I wonder why that person had phoned this other person to tell them that I was dead?


it didn’t anger me. I just wondered.


I was on the minds of a lot of people. it was my own fault for being such an easy writer to read.


sometimes it seems that only the disabled and insane like to read my books, the ones who can’t quite grasp
Chaucer.


the sixth cat finishes its meal, jumps up on the bed, settles against my left flank and begins to lick


lick


lick


lick


lick,


head


bobbing


bobbing


bobbing.










130


the beginning of


another


perfect


day.

neither Shakespeare nor Mickey Spillane


turn back the years, look you’re back at the beginning again,


living on a candy bar a day in the cheapest room in town—


trying to be a writer, not a great writer but somebody who gets checks for what he writes and lives on those checks


and doesn’t need an automobile or a girlfriend and needn’t go to work each day, just be a writer, pumping it out, day after day, day and night, words hot on the paper,
at 21⁄2 cents a word, 5 cents a word, anything at all would be enough,


writing stories for the pulp magazines, stories for the sex mags (great escapades of


a fantastic fucker) and at the same time sending out your serious stuff to Poetry, a Magazine of
Verse.


the candy bar was the bread and your blood was the wine and the long-legged, long-haired girls were chased away so you could get the Word down for the pulps, for the sex rags, for the Atlantic Monthly and Harper’s and Esquire and The New Yorker, those cold


fuckers who kept sending it all back while printing only clever careful crap.


young young young, only wanting the Word, going mad in the streets and in the bars,


brutal fights, broken glass, crazy women screaming in your cheap room,






132


you a familiar guest at the drunk tank, North Avenue 21, Lincoln Heights.


sifting through the madness for the Word, the line, the way,


hoping for a check from somewhere, dreaming of a letter from a great editor: “Chinaski, you don’t know how long we’ve been waiting for you!”




no chance at all.


it finally came down to less words after years of 5 short stories and 20 poems a week, it came down to less words and more wine and more crazy women and more broken glass and screaming, vengeful landlords and, of course, finally the police.


you young, taller, stronger in the mountains in your mind, stinking drunk, screaming


“SCREW YOU GUYS! I’M A GENIUS!”


handcuffs snapped on in back, always too tight, the steel cutting into the wrists, the sharp brutal pain.


“shut up, buddy, or I’ll shut you up.”


turn back the years and there you are, 36 years ago,


and a greater more interesting time was never to be had.
you had a faith then that is missing now.


133


but the hardest thing, the current woman, slobbering drunk, hair in face, crying . . .


“let her go fellows, she didn’t do anything, you don’t want her,


she was just along for the ride.”


“god damn you, shut up!” from the cop, shoving you through the door, down the stairway fast


where it took all your effort not to fall headlong, which was what he


wanted, hands cuffed behind you, you would be unable to break the fall . . .


you broke into song then:


“My Heart Is a Hobo . . .”


and you heard the angry cop curse in the dark


as you were led away.


all you wanted was 21⁄2 or 5 cents a


word.


son of a bitch, you ached so hard to be a writer of any kind.


why didn’t they understand?

June 20th, I’ll put you down for that, every asshole in town is gonna be there . . .




























































































136
pop!


this idiot’s wounded flower


dangles peacefully,


but boy, what a war!


just like all the other wars


but each new one seems more and more the same as the one before! nothing is very new


as I sit here arranging


these impossible words,


sifting out all the impossibilities.


this is a denouement, baby, because


you told me that you were different


than the others


but how different?


you mean you don’t piss behind


boulevard signboards?


I haven’t forgotten to water the little plants around the doorway


and I’m left here alone with our cats, three of them, six eyes looking, they are walking bellies, I feed them,


drink, type about all this,


there can be nothing great said


here, nothing even decent, nothing even understandable, and I’m just now pulling another wine cork with my yellow corkscrew, and that’s where


I got this title.


















137
the interview


I read it all.


the poet went on and on


talking about the value of


workshops.


this poet taught at a


university.


believed in teaching poets in


prison,


and teaching poets in the schools,


high schools,


reading his poems there,


bringing the word.


this poet had studied under


C. and R. and O.


yes, this poet always carried


a notebook


to capture impressions


at odd moments


else they would be forgotten.


yes, this poet revised his stuff


many times.


as much as six revisions per


poem.


this poet had been awarded


grants and


prizes.


during dry periods this poet hiked or rode his bicycle.


the masses, said this poet,


were hungry for poetry.


the reason the books didn’t


sell was not that poetry itself


was insufficient but that the




138


masses were sadly unaware of


it.


it was our duty to awaken the people he said, it was our responsi-bility, etc.


I dropped the magazine to the


floor, got up, walked to the


bathroom


and had one of my best


bowel movements in


several years.


































































139
re-union


when you left I thought you’d never return and finally I got to feeling good about that.


now it’s starting all over


again


right here


right now.


I watch


the pyramids stand by quietly as the monkey eats his fleas.


somehow


once again


we seem to be as


content as a package of


peanuts


bleached by the sun


and then


caught like


a


ringing bell.

Genius unfettered


Mr. Colskey studied under Bartmouth at the Zale Institute,


then studied with the legendary


Randall Steel at


Milestone.


he was assistant conductor under


Frank Zellenstein


for 11 years


with the Brighton-on-Hudson


Orchestra.


when Mr. Zellenstein retired in


1955


Mr. Colskey


took over the baton.


besides his directorial duties


Mr. Colskey has found time


for his own


compositions,


the best known being


his Symphony in Two Movements, The Coffin, the Burial,


a lengthy work of almost total


silence.


other works are his piano


sonata,


One for Grandma’s Canary,


and his work for solo flute,


Canard Base.


there is also his


daring operatic overture,


Photo of a Dog’s Tail


Wagging.






141


Mr. Colskey has delighted


audiences for half-a-


century now.


eccentric in approach and


manner,


difficult, reproachful,


demanding, errant at times,


still, he has left his mark


on the world of


music.


seven times married


and with some 14 children


he still presents


an ominous, stirring


and heroic


figure upon the


podium.


tonight Mr. Colskey is


to present the


World Premiere


of his tone poem,


Up Your Aspen


Dream.


parts of this introspective


score have previously appeared


in Mr. Colskey’s only


Cello Concerto,


Angels Are Green.












142


Mr. Colskey is now appearing


on stage


carrying his baton


to the applause of the


audience


here in


Sibling Hall.


now he is facing forward,


smiling,


and he has taken out his


penis and is


urinating!


the audience is


silent and frankly


stunned!


he finishes, zips


up, then walks off


stage.


we are afraid


Mr. Colskey has dealt


his career


a final, fateful


blow


as the orchestra now


strikes up and begins


to play


Anton Bruckner’s










143


Symphony #6


in A Major.


without Mr.


Colskey.

Bob


the other day we were in a


bookstore in the mall


and my woman said, “look, there’s


Bob!”


“I don’t know him,” I said.


“we had dinner with him


not too long ago,” she said.


“all right,” I said, “let’s get


out of here.”


Bob was a clerk in the store


and his back was to us.


my woman yelled, “hello, Bob!”


Bob turned and smiled, waved.


my woman waved back.


I nodded at Bob, a very


delicate blushing fellow.


(Bob, that is.)


outside my woman asked, “don’t you remember him?”


“no.”


“he came over with Ella. re-


member Ella?”


“no.”




145


my woman remembers everything.


I don’t understand it, although


I suppose it’s polite


to remember names and faces


I just can’t do it


I don’t want to carry all those


Bobs and Ellas and Jacks and Marions


and Darlenes around in my mind. eating and drinking with them is difficult en-ough.


to attempt to recall them at will


is an affront to my well-


being.


that they remember me is


bad enough.

bearclaw morning


I was sitting at a café counter


having a couple of eggs


while waiting for the locksmith


to fix the lock on the door


of my car.


the day before


at the racetrack parking lot someone had jimmied open the door and ripped out the radio and the stereo.




I didn’t miss the radio and


the stereo


but I didn’t like


the big hole in the dash


with all the wires


sticking out


like spaghetti.


locks never stop the pros


from getting in, but anyhow


as I was eating


a little dark-skinned man


in his late fifties


sat down next to me and


ordered a bearclaw and a


coffee.


he looked over at me.


“the employment office is


closed,” he said.






147


“yeah?”


“yeah, it’s that damn Reagan.


it’s closed down. you gotta go


all the way to Wilmington


now. it’s a dirty town.


they don’t even use


street sweepers.”


“gimme another coffee, please,”


I told the waitress.


“sure, honey,” she said


bringing the pot, “I guess you’re


out of cream?”


“don’t be funny,” I


said.


“you gonna go to Wilmington?” the little guy asked me.


“my car’s in for repairs,”


I said.


“how ya gonna get a job?” he asked.


“ya gotta go all the way to Wilmington.”


“I don’t need a job,” I said.


I was watching the two cooks, there was a new cook and an old cook and the






148


new cook had an order for a ham sand-wich and he started to slice into the baked ham.


the old cook grabbed his arm: “no, no . . .” he reached under the counter and came up with a pressed ham patty: “give ’em this.”


“you look like you need a job,”


the little man said.


“I’m a gambler,”


* said.


“what?”


“horses, mainly. but I also beat the


point spread, basketball and


football. I loaded


up on Tyson in the


big fight and I pimp in


Gardena a little bit.”


“how do you learn all that stuff?”


he asked.


I just smiled at him


picked my bill up and laid the tip


down.


as I stood at the counter paying


my bill






149


I flashed some green and


stuck a toothpick


into my mouth.


I picked up my change and when


I put my wallet away


I didn’t stick it


into a rear pocket but


into the left front pocket,


carefully.


as I opened the door


two little old white-haired ladies


entered.


“good morning, girls,” I said in a


soothing voice.


outside


I stood a moment


quietly in the sun


and stretched


not thinking about a god-


damned thing.


then I decided that I’d


better go see about the


door lock on the driver’s


side.


but first I stretched again


leisurely


in the sun




150


while glancing down at a


paper rack full of The


Wall Street Journal.


refreshed, I turned and


started walking back to


the locksmith’s place.


















































































151
death and transfiguration


left the place with the girlfriend screaming.


then on the freeway


I look back and there he is:


a cop on a bike with his red lights


flashing.


I pull over, he writes me up, then


* continue, make the track, lose the first 8 races, make my last


bet and leave, drive back on in, pull into the driveway.
there’s the girlfriend standing in the doorway.
she waves, smiles


like nothing happened.


* get out of the car, limp slowly toward the door.
I’ll phone to see how I did in the 9th.




































152
warriors in this place


I see a brutal and vapid face—


it’s astonishing!


look, it’s on a head and the head is attached to a body and now the body is walking out of the room.




at least the face is gone now and I pick up my chopsticks and contemplate: why did that man bother me so?


is it that I feel the waste of centuries?


the waste of nothing having gone forward? or does the son of a bitch just make me sick for reasons I don’t understand?


I need more balance, a more distanced perspective.


I should accept what is.


nightmares are a part of existence.


he comes back into the restaurant, walks behind me down to the end of the room, reaches his table, stops.


he looks back at me.


it’s a stare-down.


we are locked in a stare-down.


finally a friend says something to him and he pulls out his chair and sits down.


enemies forever have met in a




153


sushi bar.


I wish for his death as he wishes for mine.


I take my chopsticks,


smile,


and pick up a


California roll.














































































154
a sickness?


yes, I’m a Romantic, overly sentimental, something of a hero worshiper, and I do


not apologize for this.


instead, I revere Hemingway,


at the end of his endurance,


sticking the


barrel of the gun into his trembling


mouth;


and I think


of Van Gogh slicing off part of his ear for a whore


and then blasting


himself away in the


cornfield;


then there was Chatterton drinking rat


poison (an extremely painful way to die


even if you are a


plagiarist);


and Ezra Pound dragged through


the dusty streets of Italy in a cage


and later confined to a


madhouse;


Celine robbed, hooted at, tormented by the French;


Fitzgerald who finally quit drinking only to drop dead soon thereafter;


Mozart in a pauper’s grave;


Beethoven deaf;


Bierce vanishing into the wastelands of Mexico; Hart Crane leaping over the ship’s rail and into the propeller;


Tolstoy accepting Christ and giving all his




155


possessions to the


poor;


T. Lautrec


with his short, deformed


body


and perfectly developed


spirit,


drawing everything he


saw


and more;


D. H. Lawrence


dying of TB


and preparing his own Ship of Death


while writing his


last


great poems;


Li Po


setting his poems


on fire


and sailing them down the


river;


Sherwood Anderson dying


of peritonitis


after swallowing a


toothpick


(he was at a party


drinking


martinis


when


the olive went in,


toothpick and


all);






156


Wilfred Owens killed


in the first Great War


while


saving the world for


Democracy;


Socrates drinking


hemlock with a


smile;


Nietzsche gone mad;


De Quincey addicted to opium; Dostoevsky standing blindfolded before a firing squad;


Hamsun eating his own


flesh;


Harry Crosby committing


suicide hand in hand with his


whore;


Tchaikovsky trying to


evade his homosexuality


by marrying a female


opera star;


Henry Miller, in his old


age, obsessed with


young Oriental


girls;


John Dos Passos going


from fervent left-winger


to ultraconservative


Republican;


Aldous Huxley taking


visionary


drugs and






157


reaping imaginary


riches;


Brahms in his youth,


working on ways


to build a powerful


body


because he felt that


the mind


was not


enough;


Villon barred from Paris,


not for his ideas


but rather because he was a


thief;


Thomas Wolfe who felt he couldn’t


go home again


until


he was


famous;


and Faulkner:


when he got his morning mail,


he’d hold the envelope up


to the light


and if he couldn’t see


a check in there


he’d throw it


away;


William Burroughs who shot and


killed his


wife


(he missed the apple


perched






158


on her


head);


Norman Mailer knifing his


wife; no apple


involved;


Salinger not believing


the world was worth writing


for;


Jean Julius Christian Sibelius,


a proud and beautiful man


composer of powerful music


who after his 40th year


went into hiding and was seldom


seen


again;


nobody is sure who


Shakespeare


was;


nightlife killed Truman


Capote;


Allen Ginsberg becoming a


college


professor;


William Saroyan marrying the


same woman twice


(but


by then


he wasn’t going anywhere


anyhow);


John Fante being sliced away


bit by bit


by the surgeon’s knife






159


before my very


eyes;


Robinson Jeffers


(the proudest poet of them all)


writing


begging letters to those in power.


of course, there’s more


to tell


and I could go


on and on


but even I


(the Romantic)


begin to


tire.


still, these men and women


—past and present—


have created and are creating


new worlds for


the rest of us,


despite the fire and despite the ice, despite the


hostility of governments,


despite the ingrown distrust of the masses,


only to die


singly


and usually


alone.


you’ve got to admire them all


for the courage,


for the effort,




160


for their best and at their


worst.


some gang!


they are a source of light!


they are a source of joy!


all of them


heroes you can be


grateful for


and admire from afar


as you wake up


from your ordinary dreams


each morning.




























































161
a fine night


there’s one, she’s walking along looking straight ahead, sticking out her thumb, she’s fat, no, I won’t want it, let her be somebody else’s trouble.


in my rearview mirror I see somebody else pull over and she climbs in.


VIKING MOTEL, Vacancy, I park, a


woman talks to me through protective glass:


$28.

room 12, on the end.


I go in. box of a room, lumpy


double bed, torn blue bed-


spread, I yank it to the floor.


the tv is black-and-white,


12 inch, I turn it on, turn it


around to face the wall.


I strip down, do some shadow


boxing, decide to shower:


2 tiny pieces of soap and


the shower head is built for


a guy 4 feet tall.


I gyrate about, thinking,


the only meaningful thing about


the South is that they lost


the Civil War and still can’t


accept it.






162


I leave the shower, go


to bed and lie there


wet.


I pick up the phone, dial a


number.


“where are you?” she asks.


“when you get personal you get


overbearing,” I tell her.


I hang up.


I find a matchbook in the


ashtray. it tells me that


I am close to the beaches


and


4 MILES SOUTH OF


LOS ANGELES AIRPORT


I could fly to Peru.


I could fly to China.


I sit up on the edge of


the bed


dig the corkscrew


out of the paper bag


along with the first bottle


of petite sirah


unpeel a long strip of red


cellophane


twist corkscrew into cork


yank it out.

riots


I’ve watched this city burn twice


in my lifetime


and the most notable event


was the reaction of the


politicians in the


aftermath


as they


proclaimed the injustice of


the system


and demanded a new


deal for the hapless and the


poor.


nothing was corrected last


time.


nothing will be changed this


time.


the poor will remain poor.


the unemployed will remain


so.


the homeless will remain


homeless


and the politicians,


fat upon the land, will thrive


forever.

made up of


Blacks, Mexicans and poor

to fight and win


as on tv

first told us all about


it

told us

looking back


now


I can’t believe myself then:


in the bars


attempting to pick up


the lowest


women:


sagging stockings,


rouged cheeks,


deathly mascara,


yellow-toothed,


rat-eyed,


bellowing hyena


laughter


and when I was


successful


(peacock proud)


I was Attila,


I was Alexander the


Great,


I was the toughest


roughest guy in


town—


Bogart, Cagney,


Gable, all rolled up into


one.


and worse,


I can’t understand myself then:


continually choosing the biggest


meanest bastard in the bar


to come and fight


in the alley,


to get myself clubbed by




169


blows I didn’t


see coming.


my brain jumping inside


my skull,


seeing shots of


color, flashes of


light, feeling my


mouth fill with blood,


sensing my body


sprawled


on the pavement,


only to get up and rush


forward again with my


tiny hands.


there was many a


fight when I hardly


landed a


punch.


I was a laugh a


minute and the crowd


had all


night


to watch.


I’d get my beating


and they’d get their


jollies.


my face was never completely healed.


I walked around


with a fat


lip, a black


eye, a nose that






170


hurt.


I developed bone-


spurs on my


knees from falling so


hard


and so often.


yet a couple of nights


later


I’d be looking


for a new


meaner


bastard


to challenge.


but even harder to believe


now


was when finally


through some unexpected


stroke of luck


I did occasionally win


one


I was accorded no


cheers, no


accolades.


my stripe, my function


in that strange little world


was to


lose.


I was the guy from out of


town


and not even of the


neighborhood.






171


the strangest most hateful


nights were after I had finally


won,


sitting alone at the end


of the bar


as that gang laughed and


talked it up


as if I wasn’t even


there.


but when I lost they loved me


and the drinks came


all night


long.


so when I won I lost


and when I lost I


won.


and


looking back


it is hard for me to believe


some of the women


I ended up


shacking with.


they all had good bodies,


great legs,


but the faces!


the faces were faces from


hell!


they were all fair in bed


(in spite of rather a general


indifference to sex)




172


but


they had ways of flattering


me.


I was younger


than they were


and


more open to the


dream.


but Christ, they were good at


locating my wallet,


after a day or two


or a week or two


they’d vanish


with all my money


to leave me


scrabbling for rent,


food, sanity and that


infamous


lost


dream.


only to reappear again!


knocking on my 3 a.m.


door


as if nothing had


happened:


“hi! how’ve you been?”


back from robbing some


other poor son of a


bitch.




173


and worse,


I’d let them back in,


liking the look of the leg,


the general madness of it


all,


to drink with them then,


to hear their new sad


stories,


to let the dream seep


back in . . .


after all, where was I to find


a real lady?


down at the public library?


or at the opera house?


“come on in, baby, show me


some leg and let’s hear


your story.


and come on, have a


drink!”


I had no plans.


I had no idea of what I was


doing,


where I was


going,


the world was a strange and


oppressive


place.


a man had to have guts


to shove on through.


everybody was so sad,






174


defeated,


subservient.


“tell me all about it, baby!”


but in spite of everything


I liked myself with my tiny


hands and my pockmarked


monkey face.


I liked sitting in my


shorts and my undershirt,


the undershirt torn and


dirty and full of cigarette


burns and wine stains.


I had muscular arms


and great powerful legs


and I loved to walk the rug


with my whore watching


while I spouted


inanities and


insanities.


I was hot stuff.


I was young stuff.


I was a fool


and I loved playing the


fool.


“o.k., baby show me


more leg!


more!


your talk bores me!






175


lift your skirt higher!


hold it there!


not too high!


I don’t want to see


everything!


let me imagine it!”


looking back, it all couldn’t have been much better.


what a lovely


fucking


time


it was.

the love poems of Catullus


she read his poems


she read them to the men waiting in her bed


then tore them up


laughing


and fell on the bed


opening her legs to the nearest convenient cock.


but Catullus continued to write love poems to her


as she fucked slaves in back


alleys, and


when they were together


she robbed him while he was


drunk,


mocked his verse and his


love,


pissed on his


floor.


Catullus who


otherwise


wrote brilliant


poems


faltered under the spell of


this wench


who


it is said


as she grew old


fled from him


begat a new life upon a far isle


where she ended up a


suicide.




177


Catullus was like


most poets:


* understand and forgive as I re-read him: he knew


as death approached that it’s
better to start out with a strumpet than to end up with one.

dream girl


when the sun comes up in the morning


(I sleep on my belly so it’s always from my left)


I awaken to


that lovely golden light


and


I’m usually alone


and I sometimes (but not always) wonder why the most beautiful woman in the world is not sleeping there next to me?


I deserve her, I think, I deserve


her.


then I get up


go to the bathroom


splash water on my face


look into the


mirror


shudder a bit


in


disbelief


then


go sit down on


the ivory


stool


let it all


go










179


except for the


reality


which


no amount


of


efficient


modern


plumbing


can


whirl


away.




























































180
empties


we emptied wine bottles as if they were thimbles


and our 4 a.m. arguments had caused us to be evicted from apartments all over the city


but our biggest problem was the disposal of all the empties.


we were afraid the landlord would be tipped off by his trash cans, that he’d realize there were two serious drunks among his tenants


so we snuck some of the empties into neighborhood trash cans


but we still had many leftovers


which we hid in our room


for weeks on end


in cartons and bags until we were overwhelmed by


the accumulation.


finally


upon a given night


after drinking for a few hours


we’d sneak the bags and boxes


down the back stairway and


into our old car


(luckily, a sedan)


and we’d get in


the floor in back


stacked high with


bag and box upon bag and box


and the back seat also jammed with boxes and sacks of empties rising up against the windows


so that visibility was almost


impossible


while in front




181


at our feet sat the last of


the boxes and bags of


empties


where they shifted and slid


getting in the way as I worked the


clutch, the brake, the gearshift


while, of course, between us, we also carefully preserved


a couple of fulls


at the ready.


such a clinking and clanking of empties as we drove in the moonlight!


driving slowly up into the Baldwin


Hills


we were


terrified that the police might stop us


and insist that we spend


at least a couple of days in


jail;


our journey took us over


unpaved roads


in that old car


we knew might quit at any


moment;


afraid to be noticed


I’d cut the headlights


and drive in the moonlight


the forest of silent oil wells


indifferent to us


and at last


we’d get to where the road was


both rocky and muddy






182


and I’d say,


“THIS IS IT!”


then


as if the very searchlight of


God was focused on me


I’d leap out and begin throwing


sacks and boxes of empties into the


throbbing dark,


over the nearest cliff


hearing them tumble and crash


along with the sound of breaking glass.


I’d grab faster and faster


sweating, dizzy and sick as


I’d hurl the empties into the empty night


until the car was


cleaned out.


then


she would look at


me and say,


“Jesus Christ, did we drink all


that?”


and I’d smile


get in


start the car


and it felt so good to be rid of


all those empties!


all that baggage!


and I’d disengage the gears


to save on fuel


and we’d glide down out of the


hills






183


unnoticed by everything and


everyone.


she’d hand me a fresh


hit


and I’d pass it back


and


she’d say,


“geez, don’t you feel


better?”


and I’d answer, “yeah, how much


we got left?”


she’d hold up the


bottle. “enough to get us


home.”


it was a hollow, temporary victory that only someone like us could appreciate.


“we got another bottle at the


apartment?” I’d ask.


“maybe 2, maybe 3,” she’d


reply,


and we’d head back to our


place


(a place we now hoped would remain ours for a while).


we’d done what we could to


preserve our status as decent


sober citizens


and although we knew that time was always


running out on us


in every way






184


we tried our best to preserve that illusion


because we knew no one else would ever


understand the way we really were, nor did we


expect them


to.

about the mail


I get more and more letters


and they generally fall into one of two camps:


one, from ladies who say they like my writing,


and then they tell me the bare facts


of their life and they are always careful to mention their age, usually anywhere from 18 to 35.


one lady even sent me the key to her house


but since it was in Australia


I threw it


away.


one 18-year-old keeps writing, wondering why I don’t answer.


she says, “are you afraid to


fuck me?”


that’s not what I’m afraid


of.


the second kind of letter comes from men, men who are going crazy on the


job, or going crazy because of a wife or girlfriend or family and


some of the men might actually be crazy, because they write from


madhouses, while many others write from jail.






188


most infer that my books have helped them get through some tough times, at least for the moment.


frankly, I always thought that


my writing was for the purpose of


keeping me from going


under


but it appears I’ve helped any number of others.


well, being helped happened to


me too:


there was


Celine


Dostoevsky


Fante


early Saroyan


Turgenev


Gorky


Sherwood Anderson


Robinson Jeffers


e. e. cummings


Blake


Lawrence


and


many


others


and


if I can pass some courage on




189


to my correspondents


then the royalties


the luck


the satisfaction


and the


honor


are


legitimately


mine


in that


order.

have you ever pulled a lion’s tail?


I knew a girl in a brownstone


and I was a warehouseman


with a forehead pulled down over


my eyes


trying to figure out where I was at.


and one night a lion got loose


and we were in the park


and I saw it first


and I saw it later,


looking back over my shoulder,


I saw it mauling my poor girl,


and then I felt bad


and ran back


and pulled at its tail


and threw rocks


until a cop came up and shot


the thing,


and she was a shock of blood,


didn’t know who I was


and they put her in an ambulance


and then she was gone.


I walked down to the center of town to the penny arcade


and I played all the games,


the basketball game, the golf game, the soccer game, saw an old movie, tested my strength, and then I phoned the hospital


and she was still alive,


but no visitors,


and I went home and there was




191


half a 5th left


and I opened a can of roastbeef hash and some pickled beets,


but I couldn’t get over how funny


his tail felt.


have you ever pulled a lion’s tail?


I only ate half the hash


and went to bed and worked on the 5th.


it was Sunday night and I kept thinking


I probably would have been in her by now and now maybe she won’t look so good if she makes it.


why don’t they leave the lions in Africa?


you can’t blame the lions.


I finished the 5th, and phoned Vicky.


she was from someplace in New Hampshire, a little tall
with a squint eye,


but what did it matter?


the evening


was still


young.

who needs it?


see this poem?


it was


written without drinking.


I don’t need to drink


to write.


I can write without


drinking.


my wife says I can.


I say that maybe I can.


I’m not drinking


and I’m writing.


see this poem?


it was


written without drinking.


who needs a drink now?


probably the reader.

tight black pants


she was a schoolteacher and she wore tight black pants and she sat over by the fire


and talked about how interesting children were, how she liked her job with the little ones;


I had brought a 6-pack and Harry went for another one; she was one of Harry’s girls, she was 38,


and then she went for a 6-pack and came back and once while Harry was out in the kitchen I kissed her on the way to the crapper. I came back and we talked some more


and then I decided I had better leave her with Harry, and I got out, pulled out of the driveway,


and there was Harry in there with her down by the seashore


playing Shostakovich’s 5th symphony and I was out of it,


out of trouble, uninvolved,


she had her little ones and she had Harry and Harry had her, and somehow


I felt I was the only winner


driving down Pico Blvd.


past a McDonald’s


it was a quiet easy night, controlled, definite and meaningful. poor Harry would get all that ass;


the only thing that would save him now was for California


to fall into the


ocean.


















194
the weirdest day


I went to the baseball game


with Jane.


we each had a bottle with us


and were also drinking beer


on the side.


it was back in the old days when the L.A. Angels played at Wrigley Field.
anyhow, we got to


arguing


and Jane left.


I never stop women when they


want to


leave.


I figure if they are dumb enough


to leave me


they don’t deserve


me.


anyhow, I kept drinking and


got to feeling


rancorous.


before the pitcher threw each


ball


I would shout what


I thought was


going to happen.


I would either yell


“STRIKE!” or


“BALL!” or


“IT’S A HIT!”


and I was a big guy






195


and young and mean


so nobody


said anything.


the strangest thing was that


I called everything correctly.


I seemed to know


exactly what was going to


happen before it


happened.


I was so pissed off at


Jane that it had made me


clairvoyant.


“this guy’s good,”


I heard somebody


say.


“I can’t believe it,”


somebody else


said.


I was right


every time for


the first 3


innings.


I don’t know how


many calls I


made,


maybe between


50 or 60 in a


row.






196


then I got tired of


it all


and decided to


leave.


I walked out to the


parking lot and


the car was


gone.


the bitch had


taken the


car.


I had to get a


cab.


I sat in the back seat


of the cab and


finished the pint of


whiskey.


for some reason


that really


pissed me off.


when I got back to


the apartment Jane was


passed out on the


bed.


I shook her.


“hey, bitch!”






197


“uh,” she said,


“uh . . .”


“listen, I called every


pitch correctly before it


happened!”


“uh . . . ?”


“I called them right


52 times in a


row!”


“uh . . . ?”


her head rolled


over to


one side.


within 5 seconds


she was


snoring.


I went to the


kitchen and got a


beer.


I sat in a chair


and looked at her


snoring on the bed


and drank the


beer.


then I got up and






198


got a glass of wine


and came back.


I sat in that chair


drinking until it


got dark.


Jane kept snoring and


I kept drinking.


I’d called them right,


I’d called all those


plays


right.


I was young and I was


mean and I was


tough and now I had


something else going


too, something wonderful and


mysterious.


I deserved a younger


woman!


I deserved more


money!


I deserved a better


life!


there was nobody


quite as unique as I


was!


then I gave it up




199


and went to bed


with all my clothes


on.

burning bright


I read about him in the sports pages, he’s just a kid, he’s still in high school,


he’s never fought anything but four rounders, 8 four rounders in which he K.O.’d each one of his 8 opponents


in the first minute of the first


round.


they put him on the card every two weeks or so


and he waits in his dressing room,


warming up,


then they come in


each time


and tell him the same thing:


the other guy failed to show.


he can’t even get anybody to spar with him down at the gym.


“I’ll put him in a six rounder!


I’ll put him in a ten rounder!” says his promoter.


“not enough experience,” says his


father, who is his manager.


it’s hell when you’re too good


to make money.


another young fighter called Van Gogh found that out.






201
the death of a hero


I was young when my hero was young the only difference being that he quickly became famous


and soon I saw his photograph


in the newspaper


in nightclubs with starlets


and the next thing I knew there was a war


and he was in uniform


in full garb


but I remembered that in his


books


he had said that he would never ever go to war.


well, most of us have


heroes


and we don’t want them


to be


ordinary,


we want them to be dangerous


and damned well original


and never given over to


any kind or sort of


compromise.


I couldn’t understand


how a man could write so


defiantly and clearly


and then proceed to do the


opposite.


I thought that


what you wrote




202


was from your


soul


and that


such a final


cop-out


by my hero


was impossible.


so I turned on the bastard


and so did the


public—we were not interested


in his books about


army life.


afterwards he went to Malibu and sat on the beach and watched the waves break on the shore like lies like lies like lies . . .

hooked


28,000 of us sat there on


opening day


one hour before post


with our Racing Forms


and our programs and our


newspapers and our coffees


when the announcer said,


“ladies and gentlemen, we regret to announce that the mutuel clerks have gone on strike and refuse to sell tickets so there will be no


racing today. rain checks will be issued at the gates beginning at one p.m.”


an elderly man in a Hawaiian shirt and black shoes took out a .45


and blew his left eye out and through the back of his skull.


everybody felt bad.


“there’s nothing to do now,” I told my girlfriend, “but go home and go to bed. we’ll race each other.”


the next day I bought a newspaper and looked to see if it had all really happened.


it had all really happened.


and when they opened the track again 5 days later












204


28,000 people sat in the stands again with their Racing Forms


and their programs and their newspapers and their coffees


one hour before post.

found poems


I know I shouldn’t write so many poems but


it’s a form of self-entertainment which


AMAZINGLY


I am paid for.


I live alone in this large house with 2 cats (there were 3, one died)


and at my age it’s realistic to assume that I might also die


one of these a.m. nights


after writing 10 or 12 poems


and that’s where the laugh


comes in:


before I bed down I place the new poems


neatly in the center of my desk so that when the stink gets bad


and the neighbors complain or


when my girlfriend phones and the phone goes unanswered


the poems will be found.


not that my death will be tragic or important


(I will be out of


here)


but the poems themselves will


let them know


(those carping little


critics)




206


that I was good until the end


or maybe even


better.

runaway inflation


is the light bill


paid?


and the landlord?


they say gasoline


is going to go up


20 cents a gallon


every month


from now on.


soon it will


take a


month’s salary


to get a blow job


from an Imperial Highway


hooker.


time to crank grandma’s


ass out of the rocker


and put her back to work.


all facial tissue and toilet paper


must be used again and again if


possible.


even the birds on the window


sill


must no longer be allowed to


sit there


for free.


this future rolling toward us


paralyzes the wallet and the


brain.






208


those superior outer space


creatures


can’t arrive too soon


for me.


tell them to bring cash.


or maybe they’re too smart to want any part of us?


chances are


the way things are going


only the Imperial Highway hookers will survive


to finally inherit the


earth.


























































209
the significance was obscure


we’ve been married 30 years,


he told me.


to what do you attribute your marital success? I asked.


we both roll the toothpaste tube


from the bottom,


he said.


the next morning


before brushing


I rolled the toothpaste tube


from the bottom.


of course, since I live alone,


the significance was


obscure


as it usually


is.

cracking the odds


I’ve been playing the


horses


for so long


that I have seen


* whole


parade of jockeys come and go


and women too and presidents but somehow for me the jocks


have become the markers of my time.


I’ve seen them


come in as


bug boys,*


then I’ve seen


them turn


red hot,


dominate the


meetings—


almost always




*bug boy: an apprentice jock is allowed 5 pounds off the horse’s assigned weight until he achieves a certain number of wins or rides a certain number of times, whichever comes first.




211


getting that


horse’s nose


to the wire first


in the photo


finishes.


I’ve seen them


continue


like that


for a while


and then—


almost at


once—


slow down,


turn


hesitant,


unsure,


and finally


give way


to the next


hot


jock.


in the


arts,


in the field


of entertainment,


in the world


of


business


the same


process


holds


sway




212


but


the jocks


really


define


the daring


and the


sadness


of the


struggle


for me.


take Johnny


who was


one of the


greatest


front runners


of


our time,


a


real


wire-to-wire


master.


he trains them


now


but isn’t very


good


at that.


you can


see him


now


in the tack


room,




213


tiny


in his chair,


playing cards


with the


Mexican


hot walkers


and


losing


money to


them


day after


day.


“hey, Johnny,


you wanna


play cards,


man?”


jocks like Johnny


define the


tragedy of life


for me


more than does


the


passing of


Marco Polo,


Picasso


or


Henry the


8th.


jocks like Johnny


define life’s struggle




214


for me,


so small and


brave.


while Kant


lies stiff in


his


grave


and Mozart


turns to dust


Johnny


flips


down a


card


and


finally

working through it all


the bravery of some is close to fear and the fear of some is close to bravery


and I admire a brave man more than a fearful man,


and sometimes I am one or the other and often I am neither.


that’s when I’m best: neither brave nor fearful


just cracking nuts in my warm


alcove


as flowers strain to grow


as music strives to please


as the ladies love


others.














































216
giving thanks


I have to admire


that most abused of the human


species:


the white American


middle-class


male.


as a writer


I have been criticized for


writing unkindly of


females;


other writers have been


criticized


for writing unkindly of


Blacks,


Orientals,


homosexuals,


lesbians,


Amerindians,


the aged,


the unborn


the newly


born


the lame


or the Chicanos


the Jews


the French


the Italians


the Greeks


the English


or the


whatevers.






217


actually,


making mild minor


sport of


or criticizing


almost any minority


group


has ruined the


careers of not only


writers but


politicians


sports commentators,


and people in


entertainment.


it is a touchy age.


everybody is on the


defensive.


you must not


speak unkindly about


us,


they say,


or


we will finish


you


off!


now for a writer,


this is grade-a


hell.


a good writer


must simply let


it all go,


regardless.




218


if I find a Black


or a woman


or a dog


or a cripple


or a tree


or a child


or an Oriental


individually


obnoxious


I think it is my


duty to describe


them as


such.


I often describe myself


as obnoxious,


for example.


I demand that all territories


be open for


criticism!


I will not


be guilty of


treading


heavily


on the truth!


even so,


I still give everlasting


thanks


to the white American


middle-class




219


male


who can still be trashed and


insulted and


demeaned again and


again


and no one ever protests,


and he never protests,


he just doesn’t give a


damn.


but, oh, says the


politically correct


chorus,


they’re just too satisfied


with their mundane


existence!


yes, some of them


are,


but not all of them.


some of them are


just as heroic


as homosexuals


and lesbians


and feminists,


and Blacks,


and all the etceteras;


and in some cases,


even more


so.


but our white American


middle-class male






220


never protests


when I find him


out of


order.


but, says the


politically correct chorus,


that’s because


he’s running the


show!


maybe,


maybe not.


all I know is


that as a writer


he’s a good and fair


and uncomplaining


target


for me.


I can abuse him


and punch


him,


I can lay him


low in the


poem,


I can abuse him


in stories, novels and


screenplays,


and he’ll take it all


without a


whimper.






221


in our very restrictive


overprotective


society


it’s great for a writer


to have one such wide-open


playground to play


around


in.


so again here’s to


the white American middle-class


male,


the butt of


all the jokes,


the clown,


the brute,


the watcher of tv,


the dog,


the drinker of beer,


the sexist pig,


the bumbling husband,


the fat-bellied


dim-witted


nincompoop


who will take every


possible abuse


and say


nothing,


he’ll just


light a fresh


cigar,


shift uncomfortably in his






222


chair and try to


smile.


here’s to this


forgotten


hero!


now, go


ahead,


hate


me.

there is an old saying:


that those whom the gods wish to


destroy,


they first make


angry.


driving the freeways

it appears to me


that


the gods are getting

destroy the entire

whores and great poets should


avoid one another:


their professions are dangerously

from the Roman Empire to our

there have been about an equal


number of whores and

with the authorities continually

the former

a wise ass


that’s what I was on campus, some of the professors, I’m sure, feared me or at least preferred that I not be in their class.


I had a scarred and lean countenance and I slouched in my seat


hungover and dangerous.


I refused to buy the assigned books or study.


I was insolent, cool and crazy and I drank and fought every night.


my parents supported me out of fear.


I was the meanest 18-year-old son of a bitch in the world.


I would leap up in class and make incoherent speeches challenging whatever the professor had just said.


I was a pain in the ass and I thought I was tough but I was afraid to go out for the football team or ask a girl for a date.


I guess I was crazy.


all I read was Nietzsche and Schopenhauer.


I was taking journalism and art classes and


when they asked us for one writing assignment a


week, I wrote seven.


some said I was a genius.


I felt like a genius or I felt like I thought a genius should feel.


one day I got in a fight after art class with the 200-pound fullback of the football team. we fought for 30 minutes on the campus lawn.


unfortunately nobody stopped us.


I finally won although I never expected to.


I kept waiting to lose and it didn’t happen.


then I began to get popular and I couldn’t take that so




231


I pretended to be a born-again Nazi.


then I got a lot of freaky guys full of hate trailing after me so


I told them to fuck off and I became the school recluse.


I don’t know, after two years on campus I didn’t want it anymore so


I quit and got a job in the railroad yards as a laborer.


I rented a small room downtown and roamed the streets at night.


some genius I was, some god-damned genius!


I made several trips to the Herald-Examiner and the L.A. Times and told them I wanted to become a reporter.


I never made it past the receptionist’s desk.


“fill out these forms,” they said.


I shoved them back.


they didn’t know I was a genius.


one night in a bar I got in a fight with a little guy, he must have weighed only 130 pounds. he whipped my ass.


the next night I tested him once more.


he whipped my ass all over again.


a week later I took a bus to New Orleans.


somewhere along the way I bought a book by


a famous guy called


Hemingway.


I couldn’t read it.


the fucking guy couldn’t write!




232


I tossed the book out the window. a girl on the bus kept staring at me. she turned in her seat and made a sketch of my face.


she wrote her address on


the back of the sketch and


got off at Fort Worth.


I went on to Dallas, got off, caught a shave, showered at the “Y,”


took a bus back to Fort Worth and found her.


I sat in the front room with her while her mother sat in the bedroom.


we talked a long time, it was great, she was beautiful.


then she held my hand and


started talking about God and I got the fuck out of there.


I took another bus to New Orleans. I had a portable typewriter with me. that’s all that I needed to prove I was a genius.


that, and another 35


years.


































233
the dressmaker


my first wife made her own dresses which I thought was nice.


I’d often see her bent over her


sewing machine


putting together a new dress.


we were both working and I thought


it was great that she found the time


to create her own


wardrobe.


then one evening I came home and she was crying.


she told me that some guy at work had told her that she had bad taste in her wearing apparel.


he had said she looked


“tacky.”


“do you think I dress tacky?”


she asked.


“of course not.


who is this guy?


I’ll beat hell out of him!”


“you can’t, he’s my boss.”


she cried some more that


evening.


I tried to reassure her and she


finally stopped.










234


but after that, she purchased


all her dresses.


I thought that


they didn’t look nearly as good on her but she told me that the fellow at work had praised her new clothes.




well, as long as she stopped


crying


I was satisfied.


then one day she asked me, “which do you like best, my old dresses or the new ones?”


“you look good either way,” I


answered.


“yes, but which do you prefer?


the old dresses or the new ones?”


“the old ones,” I told her.


then she began crying again


and wouldn’t stop.


there were similar problems with other


aspects of our


marriage.












235


when she divorced me she was still wearing only the store-bought dresses


but she took the sewing machine


with her


and a suitcase filled with dresses


of the old


kind.

lunch in Beverly Hills


it’s a shame, it’s a damned shame,


sitting here at this table


spread with a clean white tablecloth, on a veranda overlooking Beverly Blvd. a light lunch, you might even say a business lunch, your lawyer has collected some money due you from a movie producer.


your bright energetic lady


lawyer, her assistant and my wife,


we eat and drink wine, and then order coffee and talk mostly about the impending war


as at all the tables around us there is more talk about the im-pending war (although at the table just behind us some men laugh loudly so they must be talking about
something else).


I feel very strange, very odd


that we are sitting at this table


spread with an immaculate white


tablecloth with all the successful


people sitting here with us


with the war about to start


tomorrow


or next week


as we sit over wine and coffee


on a beautiful, clear day in


Beverly Hills.


and although I am guilty of nothing, I feel guilty nonetheless.


237


I think that I would feel better about every thing if I was sitting instead in a cheap room with flies crawling my wine cup.


not pleasant, of course, but at least it’s war of another kind.


but I am in Beverly Hills and that is


all that there is to


it.


I reach for my gold card as I


twist in my chair and


ask the waiter for the


bill.


























































238
she was really mad


I love you, she said,


and spit in a bowl of


jello


put it in the


refrigerator


and said,


you can eat that later


for dinner!


then she was gone


like a whirlwind


out the door


in a rush of angry


skirt.




























































239
a tree, a road, a toad


a table of 7, all


laughing loudly, again and again,


almost deafening,


but there is no joy in their


laughter, it seems machine


made.


the pretense and falsity


poison the air.


the other diners seem not to


notice.


I am asphyxiated by the laughter, my gut, my mind, my very meaning gag on it.


I dream of taking a gun, of


walking over to the table


and blowing their heads off,


one by one.


of course, this would make me


far more guilty than they


are.


still, I have the thought and


then I realize that I expect too


much.


I should have long ago


realized that this is the way


it is:


that everywhere there are tables of 2,


3, 7, 10 or more


where people


laugh meaninglessly and


without joy,


laugh inanely without


real feeling,




240


and that this is an inevitable part


of all that,


like a tree, a road, a toad.


I order another drink and


decide not to kill them, even


in my imagination.


I decide, instead, that I am a


very lucky man:


the table is twenty feet away.


I could be at that table, sitting there with them,


close to their mouths,


close to their eyes and their ears


and their hands,


actually listening to the conversation which is causing their joyless laughter.


I have been in many such situations before and it has been one bloody cross, indeed.




so, I settle for my good fortune


but can’t help but wonder


if there is any place left in the world with a table of 7 where there are genuine feelings,


where there is


great and real laughter.


I hope so.


I have to hope so.






241
in one ear and out the other


my father had memorized many sayings that he liked to repeat over and over:


“if you can’t succeed, suck eggs!”


“my country, right or wrong!”


“early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise!”


my mother just smiled as he mouthed these


pearls of wisdom.


me?


I thought, this man is a fool.


“any man who wants a job can get one!” was one of his favorites during the Depression years.


almost everything he said was stupid.


he called my mother “mama.”


“mama, we gotta move out of this neighborhood!” “why, daddy?”
“because I saw one, mama!”


“one what, daddy?”


“a nigger . . .”


another one of his favorites was:


“eenie, meanie, miney, mo, catch a nigger by the toe, if he hollers make him pay, 50 dollars every day!”


he never voiced these aphorisms while sitting down but always while marching smartly about the house.


“God helps those who help themselves!”






242


“you listen to your father, Henry,” my mother would tell me.


that poor woman, she meant it.


“don’t do as I do,” he’d shout, “but do as I say!”


I ended up doing neither.


and the day I looked down at him in his coffin


I almost expected him to say something but he didn’t so I spoke up for him:


“dead men tell no more tales.”


thank Christ, I had heard enough.


then


they closed the lid and my uncle Jack and I went out for hamburgers and fries.


we sat there with the food in front of us.


“your father was a good man,” Uncle Jack said.


“Jack,” I replied, “good for what?”

excuses


once again


I hear of somebody who is going to


settle down and


do their work,


painting or writing or whatever,


as soon as they get a better light


installed,


or as soon as they move to a new


city,


or as soon as they come back from the trip they


have been planning,


or as soon as . . .


it’s simple: they just don’t want


to do it,


or they can’t do it,


otherwise they’d feel a burning


itch from hell


they could not ignore


and “soon”


would turn quickly into


“now.”

bygone days


once upon a time men used to wait in


the front room, smoking cigars, drinking brandy and discussing the important things, the manly things, as the ladies worked in the kitchen preparing dinner while we enjoyed the


aroma of spices, the smell of cooking meat and our conversation.


always, there was plenty of brandy and more serious talk.


we had come through some very difficult times the wars and what-not and


now we were in charge, invincible and very male: our expectations, our dress, our manner,
we were as lions resting comfortably in our homes as the feast was prepared.


it was our just due. no questions asked.


at mealtime we would fill ourselves, offering up appreciative grunts,


nodding affirmatives to our ladies; we were well fed and well pleased.


then followed the removal of the main course and on to the dessert and the coffee.


that done, the ladies would remove the empty plates and we would relax awhile over our coffee as the ladies began washing the dishes in the kitchen.






245


“let’s go back to the front room,” the host would finally say.


there we would switch from brandy to whiskey or scotch. sobered by the meal we lighted fine Cuban


cigars as the sound of running water and the clanking of plates emanated from the kitchen.


yes, the world was exactly as we wanted it to be


until female liberation began and now we are often


found in the kitchen, washing the dishes, and sometimes we even have to


cook the meal, too.


the ladies now go cocktailing around 2:30 p.m., chatting, gossiping, they get giddy, giggle, and often are intoxicated. sometimes they get into tearful arguments.


the kitchen is forgotten; the ladies are


liberated; they chain-smoke and wear pantsuits instead of dresses; they curse simply as a matter of course;
they toss around words like “fuck” and “shit” and they are particularly fond of shouting “piss off!” they spill drinks on themselves, laugh hysterically.


the men are uncomfortable and exchange little side glances; they say nothing, just as the women used to do.


the men have given up smoking, and drink sparingly:


they are now the “designated drivers.”




246


the ladies discuss everything: politics, world affairs, philosophy, art and sundry other matters.


once in a while one of the men will speak out. it will


usually be something about sports, like, “I think the Yankees need a new center fielder.”


“what?” one of the other men will say. “I didn’t hear you.”


the ladies are laughing, talking loudly, cursing, smoking, pouring fresh drinks . . .


“what?”


“I said, ‘I think the Yankees need a new center fielder.’”


“oh yes, I think you’re right.”


then the men will fall back into a profound silence.


they are waiting for night to fall.

in a lady’s bedroom


trying to write a poem


in a lady’s bedroom


(onions on my breath)


while she cuts a dress


out of freshly bought


material.


I suppose, as material,


I’m not so fresh,


especially with onions


on my breath.


well, let’s see—


there’s a lady in Echo Park,


one in Pasadena, one


in Sacramento, one on


Harvard Ave.


perhaps one of them would be more interested in me


than in a dress (for a while,


anyhow).


meanwhile I sit in this


lady’s bedroom


by a hot window


while she sits at her


sewing machine.


here, she said, here’s a


paper and pen,


write something.










248


all right, I’ll be kind:


some ladies fuck like mink


and dance like nymphs


and some create


nice dresses and lonely poets


on hot July


afternoons.

model friend


Wentworth worked as a model.


he even got paid for it and he didn’t look any different from the rest of us.


“put on your cap for Hank. show


him how you posed as a sea


captain,” said Clara.


Clara was his woman.


I was with Jane.


we were drinking in their apartment, a very nice place.


we lived in a tiny room


just a few blocks away and were far behind in the rent.


we had brought along our own wine and they were drinking it.


I was 40 pounds underweight


barely alive and


going crazy.


Wentworth got his cap and


put it on.


it was blue and flopped just


right.


he stood in front of a full-


length mirror and smiled.


I was being sued in the aftermath


of a driving accident




250


had ulcers


and every time I drank whiskey I


spit up blood.


“Wentworth,” I told him, “you look dashing.”


why don’t they give us something to eat? I thought. can’t they see that we’re starving?


Wentworth turned from the mirror and looked at me. “modeling is a good show. what do you do?”


“Hank’s a writer,” Jane said.


Jane was a good girl: she answered all the questions for me.


“oh,” said Clara, “how fascinating!


how’s it going?”


“things are a little slow,” I


said.


Wentworth sat down and poured himself another drink.


“wanna arm wrestle?” he asked me.


“o.k.,” I said, “I’ll try you.”






251


we bellied up to the table, came to grips, nodded, and he slammed my arm on the table


like a marsh reed.


“well,” I said, “you were best that


time.”


“wanna try another?”


“not right away.”


“maybe I can get you into


modeling?”


“what as?”


“or into a secretarial position.


how many words can you type a minute?”


“I’m into longhand right now.”


“what do you write about?”


“death.”


“death? nobody wants to read about that.”


“I think you’re right.”


the girls were talking to each other.


then Clara got up and went to the




252


bedroom.


she was there awhile.


then she came out with a new hat


on.


she stood,


smiling.


“oh, Clara,” said Jane, “it’s


lovely!”


“women don’t wear hats anymore,” said Clara, “but I just love hats!”


“you should, you look so dear!”


so there was Wentworth in his blue sea captain’s cap and there was Clara in her new purple foxglove.


“wanna try another arm wrestle?” asked Wentworth. “the best two out of three?”




“just pour me a drink.”


“oh, sorry . . .”


the evening continued and we got to be good friends, I suppose.


we sang some songs, sea songs among them, and Wentworth gave me a cigar. I was proud of Jane.


she had a great little figure, just




253


right.


even when we didn’t eat for days I was the only one who lost weight


which sometimes gave me the idea that she might be eating someplace else while I practiced my new longhand prose style. but it didn’t matter: she deserved the food.




meanwhile


I begged off the arm wrestling and we kept drinking my wine. when it was gone


the evening was over.


I remember standing in their doorway hugging him and her saying


goodbye, yes, yes, it was a great


evening.


and then the door closed and


there was the empty street.


as we walked back to our


room Jane said, “look at that


moon! isn’t that moon


wonderful?”


I couldn’t say it was so I


didn’t answer.


then we were standing in the hall of our roominghouse.






254


I took out the key


and stuck it in the door and it snapped in half and the door wouldn’t open and the key wouldn’t come back out so I gave the door what shoulder I had and it split open and


as it did some guy down the hall hollered,


“HEY, YOU GOD-DAMNED DRUNKS, I GOT A


GOOD MIND TO SEND YOU DOWN THE RIVER IN A SACK OF SHIT!”


it sounded like mr. big mouth lived in room 8.


I walked down to room 8 and


knocked. “come on out,” I said. “I’ve got something for you.”


there wasn’t any answer.


Jane was at my side. “you’ve got the wrong door.”


“I’ve got the right door,” I told her.


I BANGED on the son of a bitch.


“COME ON OUT, FUCKER! I’LL KILL YOU!”


“it was room 9,” said Jane.


“you got the wrong door.”


I walked down to 9 and BANGED again. “COME ON OUT, FUCKER, AND I’LL KILL YOU!”






255


“if you don’t go away,” I heard a voice say from behind the door, “I’m going to call the police!”


“you chickenshit scum,” I said.


I walked back to our room and Jane followed me.


she closed the door and I sat down on the edge of the bed and pulled off my shoes and stockings.


“your buddy in the sailor cap,” I


told her, “he gets on my


nerves.”

Hollywood hustle


the first one came up to me while I was eating in the Italian cafe and he said,


“pardon me, sir, may I read the Home Section of your newspaper?”


“no,” I said, “you may not.”


I finished eating and went outside and another guy stopped me at the corner: “hey, Jack, can you use a watch?”


he opened his hand and in his


palm was a


wristwatch. “can’t use it,”


* said.


* walked across the street and down a block and another guy stopped
me. he was carrying 2 pool sticks.
“listen,” he said, “I need 50 cents more to get a meal. and by the way, can I sell you a pool stick?”


* shook my head,


gave him a quarter and walked


on.


a man shouldn’t say “no” all night


long and I just can’t shoot a


decent game of


pool.

like Lazarus


the unknown time and place of


your death is a

also the manner of your


death?


you can go while tying a


shoelace


or you can go with a knife


in your belly.


you can go in fear,


you can go in peace,


you can go without being aware


of either.


in L.A. County General Hospital


my ward was next to the


operating room.


I was a poor sleeper


and I was often awake


between 3 and 6 a.m.


and that was when they


wheeled the bodies


out,


bodies covered


with a sheet,


and the doors would swing open


and the heads would


come out first,


then the remainder of


the body


followed,






262


rolled along by the


white-clad


orderly.


I always counted the


bodies.


one, two, three,


four every blessed


night.


no need for me to


count sheep,


I had something better.


one night they broke


the record (at least


during my sojourn),


they got up to


8.


I waited and waited


for #9


but he/she never


came.


the sun finally came up


however


and the bedpans


were rattled


and the nurses


made grim jokes


and complained of their






263


domestic


problems.


our ward was a


special ward


where they put the


desperate cases,


we were all


teetering on the


edge


and some of us


finally


went


over,


but the goings


(at least during my


sojourn)


weren’t bloody,


ugly or even


dramatic.


there was even


a tinge of boredom


about it


all.


“Mr. Williams, Mr. Williams . . .


here’s your breakfast!


Mr. Williams?


Mr. Williams?


oh, he’s


gone . . .”










264


there was never an


empty bed


for long.


they changed the


sheets and Williams was


replaced by Miss Jones and when


Jones went she was


replaced by


Mr. Wong.


and the sun came


up blazing


in the mornings


just to taunt us


and there was much


time to waste.


we were too far gone to speak


to one another and


the only sounds were


wheezing and


occasional bits of


coughing or


groaning


and every now and then


a weak and pitiable voice


mewing


“nurse . . . nurse . . .”


I left that place, that palace


of death, without looking


back.


I went down the aisle






265


between the beds


and


then down many


steps


(I didn’t count


them)


and out the front


entrance into the


street.


I phoned the cab


from a nearby


bar.


the cab took me over


the bridge,


over the invisible


L.A. River


and we went back


to my part of


town.


it was a crazy feeling


finally


being


out.


I paid the cabby and


went up the


walk.


I still had my key,


I put it in the front door


and opened


it.






266


the room was on the


second floor,


up a steep


stairway.


the dog met me halfway


up.


he was a big one,


he leaped at me


joyously,


his tail whipping like a


snake on


fire.


I was still weak and


he almost pushed me


over.


I walked on up the


stairway and down the long hall


and into the small


room.


she was sitting on the


couch, smoking a


cigarette and


reading a


magazine.


startled,


she looked


up.










267


“Jesus, why didn’t you


tell me?”


she asked.


“what’s there to


tell?


is there any


beer?”


she got up, walked quickly


into the kitchen


with an uneasy smile,


looking back at me


over her


shoulder.


























































268
soft and fat like summer roses


Rex was a two-fisted man


who drank like a fish


and looked like a purple anemone.


he married three others


before he found the right one.


they fought over cheap gin


were friendless


and satisfied


and frightened the landlord.


then she began to holler plenty


and he would listen dully,


then leap up red with choice words until she began again. it was a good life,


soft and fat like summer roses.


good bedmates


they were


until he got hurt at work, near


fatally, it seemed,


and he stayed in bed then


smiling it off


while she got a job as a waitress


in a cheap café


where the lads were rather rough, sometimes drunk, slapping her rear while Rex drank gin in bed while


she walked about, saying nothing, thinking about a Greek who came in


mornings,


touched her hand, quietly said “eggs, eggs again.”






269


Rex continued to drink gin in bed and one night she didn’t come back. nor the next. nor the next.


and with a lurch, he got out of bed and walked holding to walls around and around and around and fell, clutching the carpet, saying, “o, Christ! o, Christ!”


the Greek was very different,


he didn’t drink at all and


said he believed in God,


he loved diffidently, like a butterfly, and he had a new refrigerator.


Rex was sitting in bed with the gin one dark night


when she returned, saying nothing.


“bitch! cheap bitch!” he said as


she sat down on the bed, fully dressed, and looked pleased to see him.


later he stood upright on the floor, smiling and himself again, and
said, “I’m going back to work tomorrow morning.


and you, you stay out of that goddamn café!”

in transit


the French border guard had a black waxed mustache and an ivory face with pimples for eyes.


he stank of perfume and his uniform was wrinkled but his boots were new and shiny: the overhead lights reflected in them and made me dizzy.


he was frosty, he was filled with a


strange cold rage.


it was only 15 degrees outside


but in that building


with too much heating and all the hot lights


it must have been


110.


the heat


only maddened the


guard.


little drops of sweat ran down his nose and dripped off.


he looked dangerous.


“PASSPORT!” he screamed.


I handed it over, smiling blandly at him.


he poked at the photo.


“IS THIS YOU?”






271


“yes, sir.”


“YOU LOOK YOUNGER THAN THIS PHOTOGRAPH!”


“I was ill when the photo was


taken . . .”


“ILL? WHAT WAS IT?”


“the flu . . .”


“THE FLU?”


I didn’t reply.


he opened my suitcase and


began to take the contents


out.


he flung them all about, then


stopped.


“WHAT ARE THESE


PAPERS?”


“paintings . . .”


“WHOSE?”


“I painted them.”












272


he glared at me, his wax mustache


quivering.


then,


“ALL RIGHT. YOU CAN GO THROUGH!”


I went to work gathering up my


things.


next in line was a voluptuous


young lady.


the guard snatched her


passport, looked at it, then smiled


at her.


I had my suitcase put together


and was leaving


when I heard him:


“he said he was a painter!”


then I was out of there and soon


I was out of the building


and into the 15


degrees


and it was so fine and lovely


out there, truly


refreshing.

“dear Mr. Chinaski”


I have tried your publisher with my work.


they didn’t understand my poems


and they say their schedule is


filled for now,


so I thought maybe you should read my manuscript


and then talk to them.


I’ve also enclosed an envelope for your response.


I’ve long been an admirer of your


work,


and I don’t want to kiss your ass,


but I consider you one of our


greatest living writers,


so if you would just look over the poems enclosed, I’ll be forever in your debt.




one of the greatest living writers


read them,


trashed them, including the stamped


and addressed


return envelope.


what a helpless soft son of a bitch!


the way he wrote he


was.
















274
silverfish


“SILVERFISH!” my father would holler and my mother would come running with the special can of spray.


my father was always finding


silverfish.


it seemed to go on for days


and years on


end:


“SILVERFISH!”


I saw a silverfish


now and then


but I never said


anything.


mostly they liked to hang


around the bathtub


or in dark wet


places.


they hardly seemed a


threat


to me.


but my father’s hysterical excitement


upon finding a


silverfish


never


abated.










275


well, it did after my


mother’s death


because my father had nobody


to holler at.


then my father died


and in his casket he looked


just like—


you know—


a big one.


but I didn’t holler


anything.

the popularity kid


they are good fellows all, in one way or another, but they all seem to find you on the same day at


the racetrack, especially when your mood isn’t one of the best.


the first one, you don’t remember his name, he pushes his face real close


and starts talking fast and loud but the meaning of what he says passes right over your head. after a bit you


break away from him somehow and maybe there’s 15 minutes’ peace, then a mutuel clerk catches your eye, waves you over, he’s one big smile, grabs


your hand and pumps it, he’s asking about some-body you both know but it’s really about nothing at all. “have you seen Mike lately?”


“no, I haven’t.”


luckily, somebody behind me wants to buy a ticket and I quickly move away.


a race passes and I am walking along when another poor soul jumps me, he’s all smiles too and he pumps my hand but doesn’t say anything, he just stares, smiling, smiling.


he’s in the horse business and I ask him something about his horses and when I get the answer


I say, “great!” then spin on my heel and move off.


just before the last race I am approached by two complete strangers.


now, I am going to have to say something ugly.


I have absolutely no interest in any of these people




277


and never would approach them myself.


why do they feel a need for me?


is it cordiality? fear? respect? boredom?


and it’s not only the racetrack, it’s wherever I go.


say, in my supermarket, the manager will rush toward me, his arms widespread.


there is this sushi place, when I enter, the owner will greet me and bow low.


he does not do this for his other customers. at a Mexican restaurant I frequent, the owner


always rushes over, slides into my booth, puts an arm about me and says, “it’s good to see you!”


at this Chinese place, the waitresses gather around my table, chatter, make jokes and expound little Oriental philosophies.


it also happens to me in gas stations, etc.


I never make the first overture, I always try to keep a low profile but it doesn’t seem to help.


what is it?


I don’t find myself interesting.


it must be pity, I must look woeful, at death’s door.


but then, thinking back, all this began when I was about 16 years old, people began trailing me, wanting to be friends, attaching themselves to me.


granted, many of them were mentally defective, but not all of them.


it was back then when I first began evading


people, hiding from them, finding excuses to


discard them as friends, and it has gone on ever since.




278


I’m a god-damned magnet to the human herd and I don’t like it and I don’t want it and it won’t stop.


I’m just going to have to die to get away and even that might not work:


the ghouls will come running toward me, arms outstretched, saying, “hey, Chinaski, we’ve been waiting for you! we wanna drink beer with you and talk!


just talk and drink beer!


now we can hang out with you


forever, baby, FOREVER!”

death and white glue


the tiny summer creatures are flying all around here now and I have nothing to


smoke.


now


all around here


tiny summer creatures fly.


I usually blow smoke at them


and at the lamp bulb


and watch the smoke curl in the air and sometimes think of things like


death and white glue.


the summer creatures bite at night when I am asleep


and in the morning I have bumps on my body


which are delightful to


scratch.


my love is upstairs watching a comedy on tv.
down here I am drinking wine


Liebfraumilch


and my love considers this a


betrayal of our love, but


you and I know what a betrayal of love really is.


meanwhile


I crush some of the tiny summer creatures some find the white glue


280


but I leave a few of them


so that I am able to scratch myself in the morning.


the summer creatures are so strange I feel that they know me— one falls into my glass of


Liebfraumilch


I watch him flick and kick about


and then I


drink him down.


I hope that comedy is good


upstairs. I have my own show going on down here.

fun times: 1930


Harold was always scared.


he was easy.


we had a good time with


Harold.


we’d pretend to hang him 2 or 3 times a week.


we had a rope and we’d


corner him on the back porch


of Mrs. Keller’s place.


there was a heavy


rafter.


we’d put the rope around


his neck.


“this time we’re gonna do


it, Harold, we’re tired of


fucking around.


this time we’re really going


to hang you!”


“oh, no! please!”


he would cry silently, the


tears rolling down his stupid


freckled face.


“stop your damned blubbering!


now, if you don’t want to die either you got to drink piss or eat shit! which do you want?”






282


Harold would just keep crying.


“which do you want? answer or


we’ll hang you now!”


“piss,” he would always say.


then we’d piss on him, all over


his shoes and his pants, while


laughing.


then


when his family finally moved out of the neighborhood we set fire to Mrs. Gorman’s chicken coop.

my bully


he was big and he was always after me down at the loading dock.


“I’m gonna kick your ass,” he told me. “listen, Jimmy, there are 50 guys out here, why don’t you kick somebody else’s ass?”


“no,” he said, “I’m gonna kick your ass.”


well, I couldn’t blame him.


there was something about me, a


lot of guys wanted to kick my ass, I’d had that problem for years.


maybe I looked easy, maybe it was because I was good-natured, liked to clown around.


anyhow, I had a problem and it was Jimmy, all 230 pounds of him.


it was midweek and we were


sitting around eating lunch out of our brown bags
when Jimmy reached and


grabbed my sandwich.


“what the fuck is this?” he asked.


he took the sandwich in his


fist and crushed it into a


round ball.


then he rolled it on the ground.


“well, hell,” I said, “I’m on a diet,


anyhow.”


“a diet, huh?” said Jimmy.


he held up a big right hand and






284


doubled it up.


“maybe you’d like to eat my


fist?”


“hey, Jimmy baby, I’m no


cannibal.”


“JUST SHUT UP!” he screamed.


I


shut up.


I don’t know, he just kept after me with his threats and somehow I didn’t feel like I deserved any of it.




then management moved me to a


small office on the dock.


it was Sunday.


there was nothing to do, I just


answered the phone and tried to


look wise.


Jimmy was working that


Sunday.


he stood there glaring at me through the glass partition.


then he began coming toward me. I was feeling depressed, I had just split with my shackjob.


Jimmy walked up.


“come on out of there, I’m going to beat the shit out of you!” he said.






285


“all right, Jimmy,” I said.


I came out and moved toward him, thinking, I better get in a few shots fast because that’s all I’ve got time for.


he backed off a little and I caught him on the nose with the first right.


his nose moved back into his head and spurted red.


I’m dead now, I thought, and my left caught him on the ear.


I put a right to his belly and it was soft, my fist seemed to sink in half a foot.


Jimmy fell to the ground and held his face and


began sobbing like a


girl.


I looked around at the guys.


“what the fuck,” I said, “this guy is a fake.”


“Jesus,” somebody said.


we all drifted away.


I went back to the office, sat down.


after a while Jimmy got up, walked down


to the end of the loading dock, jumped off, and disappeared into the alley.


we never saw him again.


I never really understood what it all meant.












286


and nobody ever talked about him to me again.


it was like it never


happened.


























































































287
ow ow ow


fellow runs a bookstore


I go in there and sign my books for him
and he always forces a book on me something about the rough-and-tumble
life


but these books are written by


newspaper


columnists


professors, born-into-wealthers,


etc.


and these have seen about as much real low life


as a parish priest;


their lives


have been about as adventuresome as dusting a library
shelf


and none of them has ever missed a meal.
these books are well written,


sometimes clever


just a touch


daring


but there is an overriding sense


of comfort


in the writing and in the


life.


the books fall from my


hand.


this bookstore fellow is


going to have to think


of some other means of




288


rewarding


me for


signing my books


because reading this nicely


printed


crap


only reminds me


once again


that I am competing only


against


myself.

the singers


it was a Sunday night. I found a booth, ordered a beer and dinner, and waited. there were two musicians, a


man with a guitar and a woman who sang with the man as he played.


they went from table to table, from booth to booth, serenading the customers who were mostly families with children.


the songs were popular melodies that I had heard many times before and despised.


it was tired stuff, worn and played to death. my dinner was slow in arriving and I ordered another beer.


the singers finished at a table, then turned and approached me.


I raised my hands, waved them off, said, “no, no, no!”


they walked past to the booth behind me and began.


they had wanted to share their


mediocre music with me


but I had warded them off.


I felt quite proud of my quick decision to do so.


my dinner arrived and I ate in peace.


ten years ago, maybe even five, I would have allowed the singers to descend on me, but no longer.


often it takes a lifetime to learn how to react to certain critical situations.


290


it’s worth waiting for the arrival of maturity and confidence.


try it sometime and see how delightful it is to feel powerful and alive.


























































































291
the march


whenever I hear the March to the


Gallows


playing on the radio


I think of her


in that blue milkmaid’s dress


that showed off her


figure


there in Santa Fe.


it was raining


the March was playing


the rain was pouring down


there were even candles


burning!


it was a large but


comfortable


house


and I told her what she


was doing to


me,


how much I


wanted her,


what a miracle it


was.


I was so poor and so


ugly


and there I was


with


her!


but I was also a


fool


and I loved my


wine






292


and I foolishly played the


foolish drunk as


the March played


on and on


in that warm room,


it would end, then


play once


again


I looked over


and there she was


on the couch,


absolutely


naked,


milk-


white.


an astonishing


frightening


and riveting


sight


“I’ll be right there,”


I said, “just one more


drink.”


I never made it


there.


she drove me to the


airport the


next day.






293


some months passed


and then there was a


letter from


her.


you looked so sad


on that drive to the airport.


I’ve thought of you often.


I bought a new car,


bright red, it’s silly


but I can’t think of the


name, you know, who


made it. it’s raining now.


when it rains here it


rains like hell, remember?


oh, I’m gay now.


we live together, Doreen


and I. we have some


terrible arguments but


basically, I’m happy.


how are you?








































294
the way things are


first they try to break you with grinding poverty


then they try to break you with empty fame.


if you will not be broken


by either


then there are natural methods


such as the usual diseases


followed by an unwelcome


death.


but most of us are broken long before that


as it’s meant to


be


by earthquake


flood


famine


rage


suicide


despair


or simply


by seriously


burning your nose


while lighting a


cigarette.












295
words for you


red dogs in green hell, what is this divided thing I call myself?




what message is this I’m offering


here?


it’s so easy to slide into


poetic pretension.


almost all art is shot through with


poetic


pretension:


painting


sculpting


the stage


music


what is this foolish


strutting and posturing


we do?


why do we embroider everything we say with special emphasis


when all we really need to do


is simply say what


needs to he said?


of course


the fact is






296


that there is very little that needs


to be said.


so we dress up our


little artful musings


and clamor for attention


so that we may appear to be


a bit more


important


or even more


truthful


than the others.


what is this I’m writing


here?


what is this you’re


reading here?


is it no worse than the rest?


probably even a little bit


better?


































297
strictly bullshit


now


there’s a new one


going around:


he is whining and


telling people


that


I


was responsible


for him


not getting


published


by


The Black Vulture Press.


there have been


at least


three other poets


who have whined about


this.


well, luckily, I


don’t have time to


read unsolicited manuscripts


or


advise


The Black Vulture Press.


but


if I did


I would have rejected


all three


along with


at least a dozen




298


other


dandies


who would like to


be published


there.


that’s why I would


never


edit or publish


any


literary


gang.


at least


at the track


I can bet


on something


that won’t whine and complain


and will show me


some fight


and


some run.

written before I got one


the best writers now


I’m told


have


word processors.


I’m not even sure what a


word processor


is.


but


no matter


the tree roots tangled


in my mother’s bones


no matter


the shadows in the forgotten


canyon


no matter


the dream of the last


elephant


I’m not getting


one


whatever it


is


but


I hope it helps the best writers


get better






300


because I never could read them


anyhow.


and any boost for them


major or minor


will help us


all.


right?

straight on


there’s nothing quite like driving the


hairpin curves on the Pasadena Freeway at 85


m.p.h.


hung over


checking the rearview mirror for officers of the law


while peeling and eating tangerines that sometimes


choke you with their


pulp, acid, seeds


as


your eyes fill with tears


your vision blurs


and you drive from memory


and on instinct


until


things get clear again.


finally you reach Santa Anita, that most beautiful race-track,


and glide into the parking lot,


get


out, lock it, walk


in.


being 68 years old feels better than 30.


especially 30, that was the most depressing birthday: you figured then that the gamble had been lost.


















302


what an awful


mistake you made then


38 years ago, about the time when they built the


Pasadena Freeway.




















































































303
remember this


believing what they say or write


is


dangerous


especially if they say or write


impossibly grand things


about


you


and you


are foolish enough to


believe them.


you are then apt to smash the camera when somebody attempts to photograph you in public.




or you might get drunk


at your place


and shoot through the window


at your neighbor


with a


.44 magnum.


or you could purchase a very


expensive automobile


and then become irritated


with the less wealthy


in their old cars


who block your progress


on the


freeway.






304


or you might get married


too many times


or have too many


girlfriends.


or you could go to Europe


too often


or get high too


often.


you could


abuse


waiters.


refuse


autograph


seekers.


you could even


kill


somebody.


or


in a thousand


other ways


you could even finally


kill


yourself.


many


do.










305
now see here


playing with words as the mind fries and pops like an egg left unattended in the pan


while my cat crawls into a large paper bag


turns around


within and


looks out at me.


my woman is out tonight doing something social.


I used to mind


I no longer mind.


if she can find pleasure


out there


I would say that


the world is better for


that.


the radio music is not very good


tonight


as I play with these words


as


* now


stare at


a red package of


50. white envelopes.








306


what happened to those nights, man, when you used to rip off poem after poem?


oh shut up, I answer myself,


I don’t feel at all like examining the past, the present or the future.




o.k., my brain says, I’m going on


strike too.


as my cat crawls out of the


paper bag


it’s


a fairly slow night here.

little poem


little sun little moon little dog

in a little room


filled with little


mice


who gnaw and dance and run while I sleep waiting for a little death


in the middle of a little morning


in a little city


in a little state


my little mother dead


my little father dead


in a little cemetery somewhere.


I have only


a little time


to tell you this:


watch out for


little death when he comes running


but like all the billions of little deaths


it will finally mean nothing and everything:


all your little tears burning like the dove, wasted.

Gertrude up the stairway, 1943


I think of Gertrude walking up that St. Louis stairway


so many years ago


and myself just behind her


still almost a boy.


I think of Gertrude walking up that St. Louis stairway


and never a stairway as taut with promise as that one


with the landlady’s pictures of Jesus torn from cheap magazines plastered here and there along the walls.


I think of myself walking up that St. Louis stairway


behind Gertrude


and into her room


going in there


the door closed firmly behind us


her pouring the claret


into tall thin glasses


in that dreary roominghouse


near that very large park


with its leafless trees of winter.


standing there


Gertrude seemed so lovely


so perfect


a girl beyond mere girlhood


a figure wrapped in a perfect


dream


and as


she stood there before me


she was finally




311


too perfect:


I downed my claret and begged my


leave


knowing that


following Gertrude up that St. Louis stairway


was enough in


itself


it was


our one great moment together


and all that followed


would be


less


less


and I wanted to remember her like


that: perfect in the moment


before she wearied of the game and


we of each


other.














































312
where was I?


I didn’t know where I came


from or where I was


going.


I was lost.


I used to sit


in strange doorways


for hours,


not thinking


not moving


until I was asked


to move.


I don’t mean that I was an


idiot or a


fool.


what I mean is that


* was uninterested.


* didn’t care if you intended to kill me.
* wouldn’t stop you.


* was living an existence that meant nothing to
me.


* found places to stay.


small rented rooms. bars. jails.


sleep and indifference seemed


the only


possibilities.






313


all else seemed


nonsense.


once I sat all night long and looked out at the Mississippi River. I don’t know why.


the river ran by and


all I remember is that it


stank.


I always seemed to be


on a cross-country


bus


traveling


somewhere.


looking out a dirty


window at


nothing at


all.


I always knew exactly how much


money I was


carrying.


for example:


a five and two ones


in my wallet


and a nickel, a dime and


two pennies in my right


front pocket.


I had no desire to speak


to anybody nor to be


spoken to.




314


I was looked upon as a


misfit and a


freak.


I ate very little food but


I was amazingly


strong.


once, working in a factory


the young boys, the bruisers,


were trying to lift a heavy


piece of machinery from the


floor.


they all failed.


“hey, Hank, try it!” they


laughed.


I walked over, lifted it,


put it down,


went back to


work.


I gained their respect


for some reason


but I didn’t want


it.


at times I would pull down


the shades in my room


and stay in bed for a


week or more.


I was on a strange journey


but it was




315


meaningless.


I had no ideas.


I had no plan.


* slept.


* just slept and I waited.


* wasn’t lonely.


* experienced no self-pity.


* was just caught up in a life in which
* could find no


meaning.


then I was


a young man a


thousand years old.


and now I am an old man


waiting to be born.










































316
sloppy day


I had been up until 3 a.m. the night before.


heavy drinking: beer, vodka, wine


and there I was at the track


on a Sunday.


it was hot.


everybody was there.


the killers, the insane, the fools.


the disciples of Jesus Christ.


the lovers of Mickey Mouse.


there were 50,000 of them.


the track was giving away


free caps


and 45,000 of those people were


wearing caps


and there weren’t enough seats


and the crappers were crowded


and during the races


the people screamed so loud


that you couldn’t hear the


track announcer over the loudspeaker and the lines were so long it took you


20 minutes to lay a bet and


between running to the crapper


and trying to bet


it was a day you


would rather begin


all over again


someplace else


but it was too late now and


there were elbows and assholes every-where and


all the women looked vicious and ugly and




317


all the men looked stupid and ugly and suddenly


I got a vision of


the whole mass of them copulating in the infield


like death fucking death,


stinking and stale;


they were walking all around


belching, farting


bumping into each other


gasping


losing


lost


hating the dream


for not coming


true.


then


some fat son of a bitch with


a pink pig’s head perched


on his body


came rushing up to me


(why?)


and while


I pretended to be looking away


and as he closed in


I dug my elbow into his gut.


I felt it sink in like he was


a sack of dirty


laundry.


“mother,” he gasped,


help . . .”




318


“you all right, buddy?” I


asked.


he looked as if


he was going to puke.


his mouth opened.


he cupped his hand


and a pair of


yellow-and-pink false teeth


fell into his palm.


I walked on through the crowd


and found a betting line.


I decided to bet the last 5 races


and leave.


the only way I would stay


would be for $900 an hour


tax free.


20 minutes later


I had made my bets


and I walked out to the parking lot


and to my car.


I got in


opened the window and


took off my shoes.


then I noticed


that I was blocked in.


some guy had parked behind me


in the exit aisle.


I started my engine




319


put it in reverse and


jammed my bumper against him.


he had his hand brake on


but luckily he was in neutral and


I slowly ground him back up against another car.


now the other car wouldn’t be able to get out.


what made that son of a bitch


do that?


didn’t he have any


consideration?


I put my shoes on


got out


and let the air out of his


left front tire.


no good.


he probably had a spare.


so I let the air out of his


left rear tire


got back into my car and


maneuvered it out of there


with great difficulty.


it felt good to


drive out of that racetrack.


it sure as hell felt better than


my first piece of ass and










320


most of the other pieces


which followed.


I got to the freeway and


turned the radio on and


the man told me


I had just won


the first of my 5 bets.


the horse paid $12.40.


at ten-win that was


$52 profit so


I wasn’t on skid row


yet.


by the time


I got to my driveway


the man on the radio told me


that my next horse had


run out.


they had sent in a $75 long shot.


too bad.


I parked in the garage


climbed out


put my key in the front door


kicked it open


got my blade out: over 50%


of home burglaries occur during the day.


I checked the immediate


visible area










321


walked into the bathroom


pulled back the shower curtain:


nothing.


I walked out


stood in the front room


and then I heard a sound


in the kitchen


and I yelled,


“O.K., FUCKER, COME ON OUT AND WE’LL SEE WHO’S BEST!”


there was no answer.


“ALL RIGHT, FUCKER, I’M COMING IN!”






I ran into the kitchen with my


blade extended.


my cat was sitting up on the


breadboard.


he looked at me, amazed, then leaped off and zoomed out of the kitchen.


I walked into the bedroom and


switched on the tube.


the Rams and Lions were


playing.


I kicked my shoes off, stretched out on the bed, said, “shit.”


got up again, went downstairs,


cracked a beer, came up, let the




322


bathwater run and


stretched out on the bed again.


the QB took the ball


dropped back


looked downfield to pass and


didn’t see the big lineman


breaking in


from his left.


the lineman blindsided the QB


like a trash collection truck.


the QB was making $2 million a year and he earned much of it on that play.




he didn’t get up.


he couldn’t.


he didn’t want to.


I could have been a football


player


only my father, that son of a


bitch, said that a man went to


school to study,


not play.


I flipped off the tv


disrobed and


walked into the bathroom.


I turned off the water


tested it with my hand.






323


nothing like a hot bath


in a cold world.


I got in


stretched out,


the 230 pounds of me


pushing the water


through the emergency drain.


son of a bitch,


why did they build


5-foot bathtubs


in a world of


6-foot people?


nobody knew anything


and they certainly weren’t getting


any smarter.

often while I am up here


at the keyboard until 3 a.m.


or so


my wife gets on the telephone


downstairs


and conducts marathon


conversations


with her sister or her


niece


or somebody.


and as classical music


soothes my battered brain


and my fingers work


the keyboard


my wife works out


in her own way


on the telephone


discussing


for hours


whatever needs


to be


discussed.


some seem to need this


kind of intercourse.


their very souls


seem to be


nourished


by an endless wave


of


babble.












325


me, I’m just not a


telephone


person.


for me


it goes mostly


like this:


“sure. how are


you?


everything’s


fine.


see you


later . . .”


I used to take


my telephone off


the hook


for days at


* time. once I took the damn
thing apart and stuffed the bell and the
bell-ringer with rags.
then I pissed on it.


I believe


there’s something


about the disembodied human


voice that






326


is not


reassuring.


you tell that to my wife


downstairs now and


she’ll smile and say,


“have it your way!”


strange, isn’t it?


how two such different people can live under the same roof




like


that.


























































327
at the edge


a smoky room at the edge, it’s always been a smoky room at the edge.


the edge never goes away.


sometimes you understand it


better,


sometimes you even talk to it, you might say, “hello, old friend,”


but it has no sense of humor, it slams you in the gut, says,


“this is a serious business, I’m here to kill you or drive you mad.” “all right,” you reply, “I under-


stand.”


tonight this room is smoky


and I am alone


listening to the silence.


I am tired of waiting on life,


it was so slow to arrive and so quick to leave.


the streets and the cities are


empty,


love is on the damned cross


and death laughs in the back


room.


at the edge, the edge, the edge.


it’s so sad: the flowers are still trying to please me,


the sun shouts my name,


but my courage fails




328


as the animals look on with large


eyes.


this smoky room.


a stained rug.


a few books.


a painting or two.


a broken chair.


an empty pair of shoes.


a tired old man.


subordinated debt.


































































329
heads without faces,


seen in all the places


to go mad, to suicide or to


continue?


sitting here now is


ridiculously perfect: there’s


nothing to compare it


with.


a palsied past and a short


future.


on days like this


one can be depressed by


the message in a fortune


cookie.


November creeps in on all fours


like a leper.


there still might be a place


for us


somewhere.


it’s not the doing


it’s the waiting.


it’s not the waiting


it’s the waste.
















330


it’s not the waste


it’s the durability of


the waste.


one who thus believes,


concedes.




















































































331
coming awake


yawning and stretching,


putting on a clean pair of underwear and thinking,


you are not in jail and you don’t have cancer


but there are probably a few people out there who would like to murder you but they probably won’t actually come and do it.


you think about how


you once decided to be buried


near Hollywood Park


so you could hear the horses pound by as you slept


but lately they’ve talked about moving Hollywood Park elsewhere because the neighborhood has gotten so poor


so now you must live longer


until you learn where they plan to relocate.


putting on your shirt and pants


you remember that


you are being taught in some


contemporary literature courses


and you fart as you walk down


the stairway.


strange thoughts are much like


hangovers: you feel better


without them.












332


then you wonder if there’s any coffee left as you open the front door and look out to see if your car has been


stolen.


























































































333
the simple truth


you just don’t know how to do it,


you know that,


and you can’t do a lot of other


useful things either.


it’s the fault of the


way you were raised,


some of it,


and you’ll never learn now,


it’s too late.


you just can’t do certain things.


I could show you how to do them


but you still wouldn’t do them


right.


I learned how to do a lot of necessary things when I was a little girl


and I can still do them now.


I had good parents but


your parents never gave you enough attention or love


so you never learned how to do


certain simple things.


I know it’s not your fault but


I think you should be aware of how limited you are.


here, let me do that!


now watch me!


see how easy it is!


take your time!


you have no patience!


now look at you!


you’re mad, aren’t you?




334


I can tell.


you think I can’t tell?


I’m going downstairs now,


my favorite tv program is coming


on.


and don’t be mad because


I tell you the simple truth about


yourself.


do you want anything from


downstairs?


* snack?


no?


are you sure?




















































335
here and now


there are days


when it all goes


wrong.


on the freeway


at home


in the super-


market


and everywhere


else


continual


uninterrupted


ferocious


haphazard


assaults


on what


is left of


your


sanity and


sensibilities.


the gods first


play with you


and then


play


against


you.


your nerves


simmer until they’re


raw.






336


no philosophical


shield


will protect you,


no amount of wisdom is


good enough.


you’re hung out


as quarry


for the


dogs and


the


masses;


the breakdown


of the


machinery


and all


reason


is


total.


then


there’s always


—suddenly—


* bright smiling face with dim eyes, some half-stranger shouting loudly:


“hey, how ya doing?”






337


the face


all too close,


you see each


blemish and


pore in the


skin,


the loose


mouth is


like a broken


rotten


peach.


your only


thought


being,


shall I kill


him?


but then


you say,


“everything’s


fine.


how about


you?”


and you


walk on past,


and the goat-


faced


half-stranger


is left


behind






338


as the sun


blazes down


through


acid


clouds.


you move


on


as the gods


laugh and


laugh


and


laugh,


you put one


foot


before the


other,


you swing your


arms


as the rusty


bell does


not ring,


as inside your


head


the blood


turns to


jello.


but


this day will end


this life will end


the vultures will






339


finally


fly


away.


please


hurry, hurry,


hurry.

crazy world


fellow mailed me a knife in the mail. said it was a gift in appreciation of my work.


the knife has a lever on the side,


slide it and the blade shoots


out and you’re ready,


fast.


I doubt if I’ll ever use this weapon


but it’s nice to have a reader who is that


concerned for my


safety.


but really, I prefer readers who mail me bottles of wine


even if some of them arrive


broken.


still, you should never drink anything sent through the mails from an unknown individual, somebody might try to poison you.


but anything is preferable to the reader who arrives in person at the door. this truly upsets and angers me.


in this world, even minor fame can be a major problem.


anyhow, I’m now using the knife the reader sent me to clean my fingernails.


better this than ripping it deep into somebody’s guts.


I prefer to do that with the


poem.




341
good stuff


Red had a job cleaning rooming


houses


and he often brought me the


relics of the dead.


“nobody wanted his stuff. look


at this shirt. you can’t buy a


shirt like this anymore.


and try on these glasses.”


“thanks, Red.”


“here, try on this robe. look at


that god-damned thing. ever seen


anything like it?”


“no, no, I haven’t.”


“he died Tuesday. try it on.”


I tried it on.


it was thick like a bed quilt—


heavy, and yellow and green.


I tightened the belt.


“it’s too big for you but


it looks good. he was a big


guy. I knew him well. he worked as a janitor and drank malt beer.”


“thanks, Red, I can use this.”


“need any stockings? underwear?”






342


“no, I’m all right there.”


Red left to go clean more


rooms.


•


that big robe was like something that kings wore in the old days.


I really liked it, I’d never seen


anything like it in the stores.


it must have been passed down from generation to generation.


my new girlfriend came over that


night and we sat around drinking.


I was still at the stage where I was


trying to impress her.


so after drinking a couple of beers I told her, “I’ll be right back.”


I went into the bedroom and put on the robe and then walked out with my drink in my hand.


“Jesus Christ, what’s that?”


“this, my dear, is class!”


“it’s too big and it’s


filthy! where did you get


it?”










343


“some guy died and they were going to throw it away.”


I sat down next to her.


“it stinks!”


“there’s nothing wrong with death,” I told her, “there is nothing shameful about death.”


I decided not to show her the shirt. or my new pair of reading glasses.




we didn’t make love that night.


•


the next time Red came by he had a pair of leather gloves.


“this guy died last Friday. he worked in a box factory. his relatives came by


and cleaned the place out. but they forgot these. I found them on the closet floor.”




I put them on.


they were a little small but they were like new, just a tiny hole in the tip of one finger, left hand.


“thanks, Red, they’re beautiful!”






344


“you can’t get gloves like that any


more.”


“yes,” I told him, “don’t I know


it?”
























































































345
respite


fighting with women


playing the horses


drinking


sometimes I get too exhausted


to even feel bad


it’s then that


listening to the radio


or reading a newspaper


is soothing,


comforting


the toilet looks kind


the bathtub looks kind


the faucets and the sink


look kind


I feel this way tonight


the sound of an airplane overhead warms me


voices outside are


gentle and kind.


now I am content and


unashamed.


I watch my cigarette smoke


work up through the lamp shade


and all the people I have wronged


have forgiven me






346


but I know that I will go mad


again—


disgusted


frenzied


sick.


I need good nights like this


in between.


you need them too.


without them


no bridge would be


walkable.

the horse player


I’ve been watching them for decades. the jocks change but the horses look about the same.


the mutuel clerks change, the parking lot attendants change but the tracks do not.


I have seen two riders killed, half a hundred horses break down.


I have had horses pay over $300 and less than $2.80.


I’ve seen them run in downpours


and in fog so thick that the announcer couldn’t make the call. I’ve bet on thoroughbreds, quarter horses, harness nags, even the dogs.


I’ve watched them in Mexico and America and in Europe. I’ve met women at the track and I’ve left women at the track. I’ve attempted to make a living at the track and if you want stress, there it is.


once I spent 3 months living near the track at different motels, sitting


alone in the bars at night.


I’ve had a half dozen winning systems and a half dozen losing ones but, at the time, I couldn’t tell which was which.


finally I quit


with my tail between my legs, got a job and played the horses on the side.


I have wasted a lifetime at the racetrack and to this moment, I still go every day. I don’t know any other place to go. the toteboard flashes and I move in.


I have no idea what I am looking for or what I expect to find.






348


I speak to nobody.


I sit with my latest system and wait for the next race.


what else can I do?

displaced


burning in hell


this piece of me fits in nowhere


as other people find things


to do


with their time


places to go


with one another


things to say


to each other.


I am


burning in hell


some place north of Mexico.


flowers don’t grow here.


I am not like


other people


other people are like


other people.


they are all alike:


joining


grouping


huddling


they are both


gleeful and content


and I am


burning in hell.


my heart is a thousand years old.


I am not like


other people.




350


I’d die on their picnic grounds


smothered by their flags


slugged by their songs


unloved by their soldiers


gored by their humor


murdered by their concern.


I am not like


other people.


I am


burning in hell.


the hell of


myself.




























































351
in search of a hero


as far as literature is concerned,


for a while, it was Hemingway, then I


noticed that his writing was imitating itself, he was not really writing anymore.


as far as sex is concerned,


I began quite late and being fully rested


I gave it a roaring start, learning more from each woman


and applying it in all its fulsome aspects to the next, awakening in strange bed after strange bed (and then back in some old beds) looking out the window in the morning to check


on my car parked outside—and remembering that there was another woman for later that day and maybe even another one that night.


dinners, lunches, walks in the park,


walks by the sea, sometimes unexpectedly a brother, a son, an ex-husband and, once, a current husband. I knew of nobody with as many girlfriends as I had who was drinking as hard at the same time. I was penniless and stupid


and almost without reason.


I’d return now and then to my tiny dirty room to find wild notes under


my door and in the mailbox from


anxious females.


I had no time to respond and some then became enraged,


trashing my automobile, breaking into my room, destroying everything in sight, female hurricanes from hell.


and the phone rang without pause throughout


all this carnage, curses, wails, hang-ups, callbacks,






352


threats of love, threats of death, and if I took


the phone off the hook for a bit, soon the sound of a racing motor, the screeching of brakes


and then a rock thrown through the window.


3 times there was an attempted murder despite the fact that


I was old and ugly, worse than poor, often without even toilet paper in the bathroom. but somehow in my demented state


I became my own hero.


I’d go into Black bars,


I’d go into biker bars,


I’d go drunk into Mexican bars,


I’d go anywhere,


I’d spit into the eye of God and


even into the face of the devil.


then I’d wake up somewhere


with someone new


in the morning


and the sun would be


shining


as if for me alone.


I bought the cheapest junk cars


off the lots


and drove them to Caliente, to


Mexico,


the woman saying,


“Jesus, you’re driving this thing


like a maniac!”






353


I’d squander my meager dollars at the race track


with bravado


as if all the gods were


on my side.


it all ended


some place, somewhere,


in a small


room in downtown L.A.


I was there with this beautiful


girl with long hair, so


young, such a fine body, such


long long hair, it was almost all


too much. I think it began


in a bar downstairs or around


the corner and it was


arranged that I was to have


sex with this child of


unbelievable beauty


but there


was also a large heavy Mexican


woman there, even


uglier than I and I turned to her


and said, “you can leave the


room now.”


“I stay,” she said. “I make sure


you not hurt her.”


Christ, she was ugly.


the cheap flowers on


the wallpaper bloomed and




354


blossomed at me.


I wanted the obvious to be


obvious.


I looked at the ugly woman.


“I don’t want her,” I heard myself say, “I want you.”


“huh?”


“I’m going to fuck you!”


I rushed at her,


noticing at the same


time that the beautiful girl on


the bed was not moving, was not interested, was not saying anything.


the big woman was


stronger than I,


she fought me off,


it was a


battle, I reached for her


breast,


I tried to kiss her


wretched


mouth


but she was full of


refried beans and


good


old-fashioned strength,


we banged against the


dresser,




355


spun around,


she shoved me away,


I crashed against the wall,


she rushed at me


and swung a heavy arm at


the end of which was attached


a metal claw I


had not noticed.


no hand, just this gleaming,


metallic, dangerous


claw.


I ducked under the claw


and she swung again.


I leaped aside and


ran to the door to find


it shut tight.


I ducked under the swinging


claw once more.


you have no idea how it


glinted, glinted in the


cheap light that


illuminated that heartless


room.


I flung open the door and


ran down the stairway


and she chased me down.


and I ran out into the street,


I ran and I ran


and when I looked around


she was gone.


and then luckily for me,


unlike so many other nights,


elsewhere and everywhere,




356


I remembered


exactly where I had parked


my car.


the albatross is a fake,


the universe is a shoe,


there are no heroes,


there is only a mouse


in the corner


blinking its eyes,


there is only a corner


with a blinking mouse,


two toads embrace


what’s left of the sun


as the monkey


manages a tired


smile.




















































357
escapade


the end of grace, the end of what matters.


the eye at the bottom of the bottle


is ours


winking back.


old voices, old songs are a


snake which crawls


away.


men go mad looking into empty faces.


why not?


what else is there for them to do?


I have done it.


the eye at the bottom of the bottle


winks back.


it’s all a trick.


everything is an illusion.


there must be something better somewhere.


but where?


not here.


not there.


slowly one crawls toward imbecility, welcoming it like a lost lover.




I weary of this contest with myself but it’s the only sport in town.


















358
burning, burning


a dismal god-damned night, the birds are limp on the wire, the cats asleep on their backs, legs stuck up into the lifeless air. the homeless are still


homeless as a bell rings in my head and


on the radio a man


shoves a Spanish rhapsody by Liszt at me like an insult.


then, that’s over and I’m told that eventually something by Bach will be along if I manage to stay awake.


as if to help, boat horns now blast from the harbor.


if it weren’t so hot tonight those things would all


fit together but instead


there’s a madness in the air.


letter from a fellow from England today, he writes that I am one of the few people he admires.


well, he hasn’t met me personally.


and, something else: there are no daring lives anymore, none at all.


the only daring activity left is when we kill.
and I’m not preaching or suggesting.


I’m simply telling you how


it is.


I get cranky in the heat, drink too much, smoke bits of old cigars, pull at my left ear, scratch my


359


arms, think of bellybuttons, tombstones, cacti, watchsprings, other oddities.


well, look, here’s Bach and I’m still awake.


I need another reason to stay in this room full of ghosts, some of them my own.


it could be worse, it will be.


nights like this. stuck here. grim reality


belches, more


boat horns blow.


the years hang strangled. I


burn my hand with a match.


the dream lies huddled, muddy.


confusion and sanctity reign.


effortless, painful, obnoxious, beautiful nights


like this. lives


like this.


there’s too much to say, the dead


laugh as Bach enters


making palaces of sound, I can’t stand it and yes I can.
























360
upon reading an interview with a best-selling novelist in our metropolitan daily newspaper


he talks like he writes


and he has a face like a dove, untouched by externals.


a little shiver of horror runs through me as I read about


his comfortable assured success.


“I am going to write an important novel next year,” he says. next year?


I skip some paragraphs


but the interview goes on for two and one-half pages more.


it’s like milk spilled on a tablecloth, it’s as soothing as talcum powder, it’s the bones of an eaten fish, it’s a damp stain on a faded necktie, it’s a gathering hum.


this man is very fortunate that he is not standing in line at a soup kitchen.


this man has no concept of failure because he is paid so well for it.


I am lying on the bed, reading.


I drop the paper to the floor.


then I hear a sound.


it is a small fly buzzing.


I watch it flying, circling the room in an irregular pattern.


life at last.






















361
nothing to it


“now,” said the doctor, “I am going to explain the entire procedure to you so you don’t worry. we’re going to run a little tube down into your lungs. there’s a light on the end and we’re going to look around. also there is a little clipper attached and it will


take a snip here and there and bring some samples back so we can have them analyzed.


the tubes are lubricated and slide right in. we enter


one nostril, go down through the throat and into the lung. would you prefer we go in the left or the right nostril?”




“the left,” I said.


“the left? fine. now we want you on your back. but first, maybe you’d like to look at the tubes?”


“no,” I said.


“the whole procedure will be complete in from ten to fifteen minutes. we’re going to have a little look, take a little snip, the tubes are lubricated, there’s nothing to it.”


I glanced at the tubes. they looked like battery cables.


“nurse,” said the doctor.


“yes?” I said.


“no,” said the doctor, “I was calling the nurse.”


362


“sorry,” I said.


then I was on my back and two intent masked faces were bending over me.


I had been on my way to the racetrack.


it was already past noon.


I was definitely going to miss the first post.

A.D. 701–762


these dark nights


I begin to feel like


the Chinese poet


Li Po:


drinking wine and writing


poems


writing poems and drinking


wine


all the while


aware of the strict limitations


that come with


being


human


then


accepting that


the wine and the poems


gently


intermixing:


yes, there is a peaceable place


to be found


in this unending


war


we call life


where


things


such as


light, shadow, sound


objects




366


become


gently


and meaningfully


fascinating.


Li Po


drunk on his


wine


knew very well that


just to know


one thing well


was


best.
































































367
regrets of a sort


I’ve written all these poems


just using the words


I know


even when my writing sometimes


became almost like


listening to your


neighbor


over the


backyard fence.


but I do like


the music of language:


the curl of the unexpected


word


the sensation


of a


tasty


almost never-used


near-virgin


word.


there are so many


of them.


at times


I read the dictionary


marveling


at the immensity of


that untouched


backlog.


there’s a force


there




368


that properly exploited


would make


all I’ve written


seem


terribly simple.


yet


when I consider


the many poets


who have delved into this immense backlog:


the educated


the cultured


the


all-knowing


it


doesn’t appear to have


worked


very well


for them.


perhaps have they


chosen


the wrong


words?


for the wrong


reasons?


or without


taste?


or the need to


communicate?




369


whatever,


the users


of exotic words


have discouraged me


from trying to use my


vocabulary


as if it was


a shield


for pretenders.


and so


for the moment


for now


I am caught


with this


left with


this


and since you


have come with me


this


far


so


are you.




























370
too young


I worked for a while in a picture frame factory where my job was to hand-sand the wood before it was assembled and painted.


another man sat at a machine and he ran the wood through and chopped it into various lengths.


he worked the cutting blade by


stamping down on a lever with his


right foot.


I watched him for several days, then I walked up to him.


“Jesus Christ, is that all you do?


I mean, just pump your foot up and down for 8 hours? doesn’t that drive you


crazy?”


the man didn’t reply and I went back to my hand-sanding.


after that the other workers didn’t


speak to me.


one week later the boss called me into his office.
“we are going to have to let you


go.”


he wrote out my check and I took it and walked out of there.






371


outside as I walked along I felt


good, I felt that I understood something very special.


about a month later


it was past midnight


and I was attempting to sleep


in a flophouse


alongside 35 or 40 men


on cots and


most of them were moaning


or snoring


loudly.


I still felt that I knew


something very special


which shows you


how little I really knew


at that particular


time.










































372
listening to the radio at 1:35 a.m.


I switch the station:


a man plays the piano in grand


fashion.


somewhere else


there are nice homes


on the ocean shore


where you can


take your drink


out on the veranda


and


stand at ease and


watch the waves


listen to the waves


crashing in the dark


and yet


at the same time


you can feel crappy there


too


just like me now


having a dog fight


fighting for my life


within these 4 walls


20 miles inland.

unclassical symphony


the cat murdered


in the middle of the street


tire-crushed


now it is nothing


and neither are


we


as


we


look


away.

dinner for free


I was an unknown starving writer when I met this beautiful lady who was young, educated, rich. I really can’t


remember how it all came about. she had come by my destroyed apartment a few times for brief visits. “I don’t want sex,”


she told me. “I want you to understand that right from the start.” “o.k.,” I said, “no sex.”


one night she invited me to dinner (her treat). she arrived in her new Porsche and we drove off.


the table was in front, it was a fancy place, and there was a fellow with a violin and a fellow at the piano.


I ordered wine and then we ordered dinner. it was quiet. too early for the music, I guessed. it was good red wine.


the wine went quickly and I ordered another bottle.


“tell me about your writing,” she said.


“no, no,” I said.


the dinner arrived. I had ordered a porterhouse steak and fries.


she had something delicate. I don’t remember what it was.


we began eating.


she started talking. it began easily enough. something about an art exhibit. I nodded her on.


being an unknown starving writer it didn’t take me very long to clean my plate.






375


she began talking about the life of Mozart, slowly putting small morsels of food into her mouth.


I poured more red wine.


then she started talking about saving the American Indian from him/her self.


I quickly ordered another bottle of wine.


the waiter took our plates and she began pouring her own wine and tossing it down.


she told me that Immanuel Kant had a most brilliant mind, astonishingly brilliant.


as we sat her voice got louder and louder. she spoke more and more rapidly.


then the guy at the piano started playing and the guy with the violin joined in.


she raised her voice even more to be heard over the music.


she was back to saving the American Indian from him/her self.


I began getting a headache. as I sat and listened to her my headache got worse.


she began to explain what Jean Paul Sartre really meant.








376


the guy at the piano and the guy with the violin began to play louder and louder to be heard over her.


finally I waved my arms at her and yelled, “LOOK, LET’S GO BACK TO MY


PLACE!”


she paid the bill and I got her out of there. she talked all the way back to my place. we parked and went in.


I had some scotch. I poured the scotch. I sat on the couch and she sat on a chair across the room, talking loudly and rapidly.




she was talking about Vivaldi, on and on about Vivaldi.


then she stopped to light a cigarette and I spoke.


“look,” I told her, “I really don’t want to fuck you.”


she jumped up, knocked over her drink, began prancing around the room. “oh, hahaha! I know you really want to fuck me!”


then she went into some type of energetic dance, holding her cigarette over her head. she was very awkward, breathing heavily and staring at me in a peculiar way.


“I have a headache,” I told her. “I just want to go to bed and to sleep.”


“haha! you’re trying to trick me into your bed!”










377


then she sat down and looked at me, still breathing heavily.


“I’m not going to let you fuck me!”


“please don’t,” I said.


“tell me about your writing,” she said.


“look,” I said, “will you please just get out of here and leave me alone?”


“ha!” she jumped up.


“ha! you men are all alike! all you think about is fucking!”


“I don’t have the slightest desire to fuck you,” I said.


“ha! you expect me to believe that?”


she grabbed her purse, ran to the door. then she was out the door, slamming it behind her.


and just like that, my beautiful, young, rich, educated lady was gone.

a song from the 70’s


Hank, about the voices I hear, they talk to me whenever I get in a medication jam like I’m in now; I’m out of Valium and can’t get any until tomorrow.


I’m supposed to take Navane twice a day, one


at breakfast and one at bedtime plus three


Desyrel, one in the morning and two in the evening plus 15 mg. of Valium a day, one tab usually around 9 in the morning, one at 2 in the afternoon, one at 5 and one before I go to sleep but I like to get high and usually take 3 at a time.


I ran across a couple of old prescriptions for codeine and Percodan last week and I took 40 codeines and 20 Percodans in 6 days. because I was


loaded I thought I threw the Percodan prescription into the dumpster and scrounged around in there for 30 minutes before I discovered I had hidden it in my underwear so my mother wouldn’t find it.


I fell out of bed a few weeks ago and there was


this terrible black-and-blue mark on my leg near


my butt, so my mother made me go to the


Emergency Ward at Presbyterian Hospital and a young


intern there drew a circle around the mark with a felt pen and gave me 30 tabs of Percodan and a synthetic morphine shot, then I went to see my internist and he looked at the black-and-blue mark with the circle drawn around it and he wrote another prescription for 40 more codeines.


I say legalize drugs for Christ’s sake, and bring back Country Joe and the Fish!

.188


it dissolves, it all dissolves: those we thought were great, so exceptional—they dissolve; even the cat


walking across the rug vanishes in a puff of smoke;


nations break apart at the seams


and overnight become


tenth-rate powers;


the .330 hitter can no longer


see the ball, he dips to .188,


sits apart on the bench,


wonders about


the remainder of his life;


the heavyweight champ is knocked senseless by a 40-to-one underdog;


it dissolves, it all dissolves—


lovers leave and


old cars break down


on the freeway at rush hour;


I look at a photo of myself


and think,


who’s that


awkward


foolish


old man?


it dissolves—the nights of hurricane and


hunger


have turned


placid;


I search for a partial set of my teeth


on the bookcase


shelf;


and I can’t even think of




380


a last line


for this poem;


sometimes


before his death


a man can see


his


ghost.

war some of the time


when you write a poem it


needn’t be intense


it


can be nice and


easy


and you shouldn’t necessarily


be


concerned only with things like anger or love or need;


at any moment the


greatest accomplishment might be to simply get


up and tap the handle


on that leaking toilet;


I’ve


done that twice now while typing


this


and now the toilet is


quiet.


to


solve simple problems: that’s


the most


satisfying thing, it


gives you a chance and it


gives everything else a chance


too.


we were made to accomplish the easy things


and made to live through the things that are hard.

at last


I am sitting here


in darkest night


as one more poem


arrives


and says


wait,


wait,


watch me as I strut


across the page


letter by letter


like one of your


cats


walking across the


hood of your


car.


watch me,


here I


go


again


all the way to


Mexico


or Java


or down


into your


gut.


wait


some


more,


these nights


are meant for that,


and for


me


because




383


* control you,
a captive there sitting before this illuminated screen.


you will do as I want because


* write


you,


not the other


way around.


I always have.


I always will.


I am the last


poem of this


night


and as you


sleep later in the


next room


in the dark


you will


forget about


me,


forget everything,


you with your


dumb mouth


open,


as you snore your


heavy


sleep,




384


I will be here


waiting,


immortal,


and


when you are


dead


and the black


sky flashes


red


for you


for the last time,


your dumb


bones


will amount to


nothing


more


than


dust.


but I will


live on.










































385
misbegotten paradise


the bad days and the bad nights now come too often,


the old dream of having a few easy years before death—


that dream vanished as the other dreams have.


too bad, too bad, too bad.


from the beginning, through the


middle years and up to the


end:


too bad, too bad, too bad.


there were moments,


sparkles of hope


but they quickly dissolved


back into the same old


formula:


the stink of reality.


even when luck was


there


and life danced in the


flesh,


we knew the stay


would be


short.


too bad, too bad, too bad.


we wanted more than


there could ever be:


women of love and


laughter,




386


nights wild enough for the


tiger,


we wanted days that


strolled through


life


with some grace,


a bit of


meaning,


a plausible use,


not something


just to


waste,


but something to


remember,


something


with which to


poke death


in the gut.


too bad, too bad, too bad.


in the totality of


all things, of course,


our petty agony is


stupid


and vain


but I feel that our


dreams were


not.


and we are not alone.


the relentless factors are


not a personal




387


vendetta against a


single


self.


others feel the same


searing


disorder,


go mad, suicide, go


dull, run stricken to


imaginary


gods,


or go drunk, go drugged,


go naturally


silly,


disappear into the mass of


nothingness


we call families,


cities,


countries.


but fate is not entirely


to blame.


we have wasted


our chances,


we have strangled


our own hearts.


too bad, too bad, too bad.


now we are the citizens of


nothing.










388


the sun


itself


knows


the sad truth of


how we surrendered


our lives


and deaths


to simple


ritual,


useless


craven


ritual,


and then


slinking away


from the face of


glory,


turning our dreams into


dung,


how we said


no, no, no, no,


to the most beautiful


YES


ever uttered:


life


itself.
























389
my big night on the town


sitting on a 2nd-floor porch at 1:30 a.m.


while


looking out over the city.


it could be worse.


we needn’t accomplish great things, we only


need to accomplish little things that make us feel


better or


not so bad.


of course, sometimes the fates will not allow us to do this.




then, we must outwit the fates.


we must be patient with the gods.


they like to have fun,


they like to play with us.


they like to test us.


they like to tell us that we are weak and stupid, that we are finished.




the gods need to be amused.


we are their toys.


as I sit on the porch a bird begins


to serenade me from a tree nearby in the dark.


it is a mockingbird.


I am in love with mockingbirds.




390




I make bird sounds.


he waits.


then he makes them back.


he is so good that I laugh.


we are all so easily pleased,


all of us living things.


now a slight drizzle begins to


fall.


little chill drops fall on my


hot skin.


I am half asleep.


I sit in a folding chair with my


feet up on the railing


as the mockingbird begins


to repeat every bird song


he has heard that


day.


this is what we old guys do


for amusement


on Saturday


nights:


we laugh at the gods, we


settle old scores with


them,


we rejuvenate


as the lights of the city


blink below,




391


as the dark tree


holding the mockingbird


watches over us,


and as the world,


from here,


looks as good as it ever


will.


















































































392
nobody but you


nobody can save you but


yourself.


you will be put again and again


into nearly impossible


situations.


they will attempt again and again


through subterfuge, guise and


force


to make you submit, quit and/or die quietly inside.


nobody can save you but


yourself


and it will be easy enough to fail


so very easily


but don’t, don’t, don’t.


just watch them.


listen to them.


do you want to be like that?


a faceless, mindless, heartless


being?


do you want to experience


death before death?


nobody can save you but


yourself


and you’re worth saving.


it’s a war not easily won


but if anything is worth winning then this is it.


think about it.


think about saving your self.




393


your spiritual self.


your gut self.


your singing magical self and


your beautiful self.


save it.


don’t join the dead-in-spirit.


maintain your self


with humor and grace


and finally


if necessary


wager your life as you struggle,


damn the odds, damn


the price.


only you can save your


self.


do it! do it!


then you’ll know exactly what


I am talking about.




































394
like a dolphin


dying has its rough edge.


no escaping now.


the warden has his eye on me.


his bad eye.


I’m doing hard time now.


in solitary.


locked down.


I’m not the first nor the last.


I’m just telling you how it is.


I sit in my own shadow now.


the face of the people grows dim.


the old songs still play.


hand to my chin, I dream of


nothing while my lost childhood


leaps like a dolphin


in the frozen sea.
