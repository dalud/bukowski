tonight 
drinking Singha 
malt liquor from 
Thailand 
and listening to 
Wagner 

I can’t believe that 
he is not in 
the other 
room 
or around the 
corner 
or alive 
someplace 
tonight 

and he is 
of course 
as I am taken 
by the sound of 
him 
and little goosebumps run along 
both of my 
arms 
then a 
chill 

he’s here 
now
